abstract = {Pre-fabricated composite buildings are proposed as sustainable sheltering and housing solutions for developing countries. This work compares different passive cooling techniques of shading, natural ventilation, cool painting and increase in thickness of interior gypsum plaster for these buildings to tackle overheating in hot climates. The studied techniques are measured and compared in terms of indoor air temperature by calculating four indicators of maximum, minimum, average of highest 5{\%} and average of lowest 5{\%} temperatures as well as thermal comfort of the occupants based on two acceptability rates of ASHRAE 55 and three acceptability limits of EN 15251 standards in three climates: Porto, Nairobi and Mumbai. The findings of this comparison bring insights into the effectiveness of passive cooling techniques, that can be highly beneficial at design level. Results point out improvements by all studied techniques, even if these quantitatively depend on the presence of the occupants and the choice of the performance indicators. Finally, further indicators such as stored heat, solar radiation heat gain and surface temperature are analyzed, to explain causes and effects associated with studied passive cooling techniques. Results of these comparisons pointed out that the combined implementation of all techniques combined is effective enough to provide thermal comfort of the occupants during almost all annual occupancy in Nairobi measured by acceptability rate of 80{\%} of ASHRAE 55 and Category III of EN 15251.},

abstract = {Heat exchange between buildings and the surrounding environment is due to convective and radiative heat flows. In this study a detailed building energy simulation tool (BES) is used to analyze the effect of multiple shortwave and longwave inter-reflections exchanges between neighboring buildings with the main purpose to evaluate their influence on the heat fluxes on the external walls of street canyon buildings. These radiative exchanges modify the canyon microclimate thus influencing space cooling and heating demand of buildings. A TRNSYS canyon model has been created and validated with experimental data [1]. With the proposed model, most of the thermal effects of the urban radiative microclimate can be considered and quantified on street canyon scale. Due to multiple reflections, more solar and thermal radiation remain trapped in an urban fabric so that much more radiation is absorbed in the buildings fa{\c{c}}ades in a street canyon. For this reason, some comparison has been performed between street canyon building (SCB) and stand-alone building (SAB), to account for the inter reflections between the buildings. Energy and thermodynamic studies are performed in a canyon with two orientations (N/S and E/W) and for three aspect ratio (H/W=0.5, 1 and 2). The goal is to characterize how the orientations and geometrical parameter change the inter reflections inside an urban canyon.},

abstract = {In the last fifteen years, Europe has been involved in the major development of photovoltaic (PV) solar energy. The Kyoto Protocol requirements and the European Union (EU) directives to promote the use of renewable energy sources (RES) together with environmental policies introduced for the development and use of alternative energies have generated a large number of market opportunities for this sector. Differences in the application of energy policies have caused significant imbalances in electricity systems and distortion of electricity prices. The main concern of governments is to define the support schemes to be used and how to combine them in the most profitable manner. The aim of this paper is to provide a comparative cost-effectiveness assessment using feed-in tariffs (FiT) and net-metering (NM) schemes in some representative EU countries. The authors have developed an economic model to evaluate the profitability of PV projects combining these support schemes. Results show not only the circumstances under which solar energy is economically profitable, but also the kind of PV systems, locations, minimum levels of tariff prices and specific combination of support schemes that should be promoted.},

abstract = {There is worldwide a trend towards urbanization, and cities try to improve their sustainability by saving natural resources and energy, and to mitigate the impact of climate change. Therefore growing cities need to optimize the energy demand of their new and existing buildings. There are a large number of urban scale phenomena that influence the energy demand of buildings. One of the most important influencing phenomena is the shortwave solar and longwave radiation exchange within an urban environment. It was demonstrated that the influence of neighbouring buildings has to be considered in detail to predict correctly the building energy demand. In this study, space cooling demand of stand-alone buildings is compared with buildings in an urban street canyon configuration. Detailed radiation models for the solar and longwave radiation are used to determine the radiation exchange between the buildings. The results show a strong influence of neighbouring buildings on the space cooling demands. This influence is strongly dependent on the shading device control strategy incorporated in the building energy management. Counterintuitively the space cooling demands are in some cases are higher for low values of solar irradiance, because the shading device control directs the devices to remain open during longer time periods when irradiance values are low, leading to higher total solar gains through the windows.},

An important part of the heat exchange between buildings and the ambient surrounding is due to convective and radiative heat flows. In this study detailed building energy simulation (BES) is used to analyse the effect of neighbouring buildings on these heat flows and their influence on the space cooling and heating demand of buildings. BESs were conducted for stand-alone buildings and buildings in street canyon. This study demonstrates the importance of accounting for the urban microclimate for the prediction of the energy demand of buildings. With the proposed model most of the thermal effects of the urban microclimate can be captured and quantified on street canyon scale. Due to multiple reflections more solar and thermal radiation is absorbed at the fa{\c{c}}ades of buildings in street canyons than at fa{\c{c}}ades of stand-alone buildings. These effects cause higher surface temperatures in street canyons leading to higher space cooling and lower space heating demands. Other reasons are the lower convective heat transfer coefficients in street canyons, the reduced removal of heat from street canyons and the urban heat island effect.},

abstract = {Increasing penetration of residential photovoltaic (PV) systems has intensified concerns over the related impacts on utility revenue and the equity of deployment subsidies. Community solar (CS) has surfaced as an alternative deployment model for PV that could potentially mitigate these concerns, while integrating distributed solar PV. Given the potential that CS holds in stabilizing the customer-utility relationship amid deeper penetration of distributed solar, in this paper we combine four complementary datasets to analyze how policy, regulatory, and market factors impact the deployment of CS. Specifically, we present a detailed assessment of CS deployment in the United States, including pertinent insights relating to nameplate capacity, billing models, propensities of off-taker utilities to adopt different types of CS, and local market and policy drivers. We find that accounting for both underlying demand and policy/regulatory conditions is essential for understanding the nuanced connections between utility strategy and CS adoption. A particularly interesting finding, stemming consistently across the multiple data streams we analyze, is that utilities are motivated to develop CS not only to satisfy consumer demand or regulatory requirements for renewable energy, but also to alleviate revenue losses related to residential solar PV.},

However, this technique is often ruled out by building designers since its ability to maintain comfort conditions is difficult to assess. Indeed, the cooling effect of this technique driven by wind and stack effects is highly dependent on outdoor conditions. This article intends to review the techniques of single-sided natural ventilation and the tools available to assess the performance of this technique. Then, the performance of single-sided natural ventilation is assessed for low-energy office buildings in two European climates. The methodology is based on the use of a building energy simulation program coupled with a recently developed correlation for single-sided ventilation. Several cases of office buildings are assessed, taking into account the main factors influencing the natural ventilation potential such as building loads, thermal inertia and orientation.

abstract = {Throughout history, natural ventilation has remained the preferred choice for the majority of residential buildings, while, in commercial buildings, natural ventilation went from being the single option to somewhat of a lost art as mechanical ventilation systems and air conditioning became the standard during the second half of the twentieth century. Recently, as a result of environmental concerns, in particular the greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, interest in natural ventilation in commercial buildings has seen a resurgence. Unfortunately, the hiatus in natural ventilation use in these buildings has resulted in the loss of existing design know-how and consequently limited new developments in a period during which comfort and indoor air quality performance standards have continuously risen. Nevertheless, the past 25 years has seen significant advances in our understanding of the fluid mechanics of natural ventilation and Architectural Fluid Mechanics has developed as a new subject. In response to these new scientific advances and in an attempt to restore confidence in the applicability of natural ventilation in practice, this paper presents ten questions about building natural ventilation that span the different scales of the problem, from an urban context down to the neighbourhood and the building itself. These questions are commonly asked when a designer is considering natural ventilation as the preferred means of cooling a non-domestic building, and the answers are intended to provide succinct links to the latest knowledge, identify areas that require additional research and assist designers in making appropriate decisions.},

abstract = {In 1997, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) formed the Task Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impact and Climate Assessment (TGICA)1 whose role is to provide regional climate change information with particular focus on capacity building for future IPCC assessments. These Guidelines represent part of an initiative by the Task Group to improve consistency in the selection and application of scenarios2 in climate impact and adaptation assessments and, in so doing, to reduce the time lag of information exchange between the different scientific communities engaged in climate change research. They offer guidance on the interpretation and application of scenario data in impact and adaptation assessment. They also provide user support for the IPCC Data Distribution Centre (DDC), which has been established under the direction of the Task Group to make freely available a number of recent global data sets of baseline and scenario information on climatic, environmental and socio-economic conditions. This is a completely revised version of the original Guidelines, which first appeared in December 1999. Since that time a new set of emissions scenarios (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, SRES Nakicenovic et al., 2000) and new chapters on scenarios (Mearns et al., 2001; Carter et al., 2001, 2007; Morita et al., 2001; Nakicenovic et al., 2007) have been prepared by the IPCC. Furthermore, large amounts of new information related to the SRES scenarios have been added to the Data Distribution Centre and more detailed guidance material on specific topics described in this document has been developed or is under development by the TGICA in parallel with these generic guidelines, concerning: Climate scenarios developed from regional climate model experiments (Mearns et al., 2003) Climate scenarios developed using statistical downscaling techniques (Wilby et al., 2004) Global and regional sea level scenarios Socio-economic scenarios, including population, gross domestic product and land-use change Scenarios of atmospheric composition, including carbon dioxide concentration, tropospheric and near-surface ozone abundance and sulphur concentration and deposition These can (or will) be found on the DDC and are referenced at appropriate points in this document, the individual sections of which have been designed as stand-alone introductions to different sets of information on the DDC website.},

abstract = {The action of opening a window is the most intuitive and simple response to controlling overheating in a room. However, it relies on the vagaries of occupant interaction to exploit the passive design potential and achieve comfortable results. An understanding of occupant behaviour is thus of significance in the design and evaluation of naturally ventilated buildings. This paper demonstrates the link between facade design, thermal performance, occupant perception, and window use in naturally ventilated offices in summer, based on a pilot study monitoring offices in Cambridge, UK. Survey results indicate that facade design has a large impact on the occupants' perceived control over and satisfaction with their environments. The research reveals that there is a close connection between perceived control and actual control (with respect to window use), and that occupants with a high level of perceived control more frequently use their windows than others with a low level of perceived control. Positive feedback loops between occupant action and effect reinforce appropriate behaviour and the paper shows that it is possible to derive statistically significant behavioural models to predict window use for different facade conditions.},

@article{Breesch2010,
abstract = {Natural night ventilation is an interesting passive cooling method in moderate climates. Driven by wind and stack generated pressures, it cools down the exposed building structure at night, in which the heat of the previous day is accumulated. The performance of natural night ventilation highly depends on the external weather conditions and especially on the outdoor temperature. An increase of this outdoor temperature is noticed over the last century and the IPCC predicts an additional rise to the end of this century. A methodology is needed to evaluate the reliable operation of the indoor climate of buildings in case of warmer and uncertain summer conditions. The uncertainty on the climate and on other design data can be very important in the decision process of a building project. The aim of this research is to develop a methodology to predict the performance of natural night ventilation using building energy simulation taking into account the uncertainties in the input. The performance evaluation of natural night ventilation is based on uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. The results of the uncertainty analysis showed that thermal comfort in a single office cooled with single-sided night ventilation had the largest uncertainty. The uncertainties on thermal comfort in case of passive stack and cross ventilation were substantially smaller. However, since wind, as the main driving force for cross ventilation, is highly variable, the cross ventilation strategy required larger louvre areas than the stack ventilation strategy to achieve a similar performance. The differences in uncertainty between the orientations were small. Sensitivity analysis was used to determine the most dominant set of input parameters causing the uncertainty on thermal comfort. The internal heat gains, solar heat gain coefficient of the sunblinds, internal convective heat transfer coefficient, thermophysical properties related to thermal mass, set-point temperatures controlling the natural night ventilation, the discharge coefficient Cd of the night ventilation opening and the wind pressure coefficients Cp were identified to have the largest impact on the uncertainty of thermal comfort. The impact of the warming climate on the uncertainty of thermal comfort was determined. The uncertainty on thermal comfort appeared to increase significantly when a weather data set with recurrence time of 10years (warm weather) was applied in the transient simulations in stead of a standard weather data set. Natural night ventilation, designed for normal weather conditions, was clearly not able to ensure a high probability of good thermal comfort in warm weather. To ensure a high probability of good thermal comfort and to reduce the performance uncertainty in a warming climate, natural night ventilation has to be combined with additional measures. Different measures were analysed, based on the results of the sensitivity analysis. All the measures were shown to significantly decrease the uncertainty of thermal comfort in warm weather. The study showed the importance to carry out simulations with a warm weather data set together with the analysis under typical conditions. This approach allows to gain a better understanding of the performance of a natural night ventilation design, and to optimize the design to a robust solution.},

abstract = {'Mixed-mode' refers to a hybrid approach to space conditioning that uses a combination of natural ventilation and some form of mechanical ventilation and/or cooling. This study focuses on mixed-mode in buildings with operable windows (as opposed to natural ventilation through vents). By utilizing active cooling only when and where it is necessary, a well-designed mixed-mode building offers the potential to improve the indoor environmental quality while minimizing the significant energy and operating costs of air-conditioning. However, limited information exists on the performance of mixed-mode buildings, particularly with regard to occupant satisfaction, and evidence can be a powerful part of the argument to minimize the use of air-conditioning. The results of web-based surveys conducted in twelve mixed-mode buildings are described and compared with a benchmarking database of 370 buildings, with over 43 000 individual responses. The survey focuses on seven areas of indoor environmental performance: thermal comfort, air quality, acoustics, lighting, cleanliness, spatial layout, and office furnishings. The mixed-mode buildings are performing exceptionally well compared with the overall building stock, especially with regard to thermal comfort and air quality. The best performers were those that were newer, in more moderate climates, had radiant cooling or mechanical ventilation only, and allowed high degrees of direct user control without changeover window interlock systems.},

abstract = {For the design of natural ventilation systems for passive cooling in buildings, engineers and architects are interested in the prediction of ventilation rates as a function of position and size of the ventilation openings. In common use, there are both simple and detailed (i.e., multizone) ventilation models which rely basically on the same Bernoulli algorithm to describe airflow through large openings. An important source of uncertainty is related to the attribution of discharge coefficients. The present study was undertaken to improve our knowledge on velocity and discharge coefficients when measured in real buildings. The experiments were performed on a naturally ventilated three-level office building where the staircase acted as exhaust chimney. In order to keep the flow pattern stable, a condition for air flow measurements to be reproducible, the experiments were performed on windless nights where the flow was only driven by stack pressure. Air flow patterns were traced with smoke and tracer gas. In a first set of experiments, air velocities, contraction and velocity coefficients and the position of the neutral pressure level (NPL) have been measured, in a second set of experiments, the resulting effective area of a combination of two openings in series. Air flow rates derived from velocity measurements in the open doorways were found to be in agreement with the flow rates obtained with a constant injection tracer gas technique, with an uncertainty of ± 20{\%}. The velocity coefficient $\phi$ = 0.7±0.1 and jet contraction coefficients ɛ = 0.85±0.1 found in the experiments are shown to be in agreement with the generally accepted value of the discharge coefficient Cd = $\phi$ ɛ = 0.6±0.1, giving new justification for its use in the models. Basic configurations for ventilative cooling are given to illustrate how qualitative modeling used in simple models can give valuable information to the designer.},

abstract = {The adaptive hypothesis predicts that contextual factors and past thermal history modify building occupants' thermal expectations and preferences. One of the predictions of the adaptive hypothesis is that people in warm climate zones prefer warmer indoor temperatures than people living in cold climate zones. This is contrary to the static assumptions underlying the current ASHRAE comfort standard 55-92. To examine the adaptive hypothesis and its implications for Standard 55-92, the ASHRAE RP-884 project assembled a quality-controlled database from thermal comfort field experiments worldwide (circa 21,000 observations from 160 buildings). Our statistical analysis examined the semantics of thermal comfort in terms of thermal sensation, acceptability, and preference, as a function of both indoor and outdoor temperature. Optimum indoor temperatures tracked both prevailing indoor and outdoor temperatures, as predicted by the adaptive hypothesis. The static predicted means vote (PMV) model was shown to be partially adaptive by accounting for behavioral adjustments, and fully explained adaptation occurring in HVAC buildings. Occupants in naturally ventilated buildings were tolerant of a significantly wider range of temperatures, explained by a combination of both behavioral adjustment and psychological adaptation. These results formed the basis of a proposal for a variable indoor temperature standard.},

abstract = {In a dense urban area, pavement watering could be a solution to mitigate the Urban Heat Island. So far, mainly experimental studies have been used to evaluate watering techniques. In this study, a soil model dedicated to pavement watering has been developed within the urban climate model SOLENE-microclimat. This watering model is presented and evaluated via a measurement campaign performed on an asphalt car park during warm days. The measurement campaign reveals that the surface cooling is mainly due to evaporation (80{\%}). However, under warm conditions, the heat flux exchanged between the runoff water and the surface should also be modelled. Indeed, watering events are modelled through a runoff convective heat flux and a latent heat flux. The mean daily RMSE between estimated and observed surface temperature is 1.04°C, 0.86°C, 0.66°C, 0.35°C and 0.21°C respectively at the surface, 5 cm-, 10 cm-, 34 cm- and 50 cm-depths.},

abstract = {As building energy models become more accurate and numerically efficient, model-based optimization of building design and operation is becoming more practical. The state-of-the-art typically couples an optimizer with a building energy model which tends to be time consuming and often leads to suboptimal results because of the mathematical properties of the energy model. To mitigate this issue, we present an approach that begins by sampling the parameter space of the building model around its baseline. An analytical meta-model is then fit to this data and optimization can be performed using different optimization cost functions or optimization algorithms with very little computational effort. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is also performed to identify the most influential parameters for the optimization. A case study is explored using an EnergyPlus model of an existing building which contains over 1000 parameters. When using a cost function that penalizes thermal comfort and energy, 45{\%} annual energy reduction is achieved while simultaneously increasing thermal comfort by a factor of two. We compare the optimization using the meta-model approach with an approach using the EnergyPlus model integrated with the optimizer on a smaller problem using only seven optimization parameters illustrating good performance.},

abstract = {This paper provides a critical review on the building neighborhood properties influencing the energy and airflows in urban neighborhoods. Specifically, the review focus is on the multi-scale modeling required to quantify this influence of the building neighborhood properties on the energy consumption in buildings. The energy consumption patterns of buildings located in dense city centers are highly dependent on the surrounding urban neighborhood, compared to the low density, suburban/rural regions, where the building energy consumption patterns are similar to an isolated building energy consumption patterns. Due to the complex nature of the outdoor airflow around the buildings in urban neighborhoods, a practical modeling approach utilizes multi-scale modeling to account for different spatial and temporal scales for the relevant transport processes. Specifically, this modeling approach aims to identify the most important neighborhood properties influencing building energy consumption. The urban morphology parameters, such as the urban plan area density, frontal area density, and mean height of the buildings represent successful examples of emerging properties suitable for development of generalized solutions and physical models at the neighborhood scale. This paper also reviews different modeling approaches that account for the impacts of the urban neighborhood properties on the thermo-fluid property of the air, surfaces, and sky in the built environment as the required inputs for accurate assessment of building energy consumption. Furthermore, these emerging properties of urban neighborhoods directly affect (1) the mitigation strategies for a better adaptation, (2) design performance metrics of neighborhoods for the green building rating systems, and (3) socio-environmental factors.},

abstract = {Mean wind pressure coefficients (Cp) are key input parameters for air infiltration and ventilation studies. However, building energy simulation and stand-alone airflow network programs usually only provide and/or use a limited amount of Cp data, which are based on several assumptions. An important assumption consists of using surface-averaged Cp values instead of local Cp values with a high resolution in space. This paper provides information on the uncertainty in the calculated airflow rate due to the use of surface-averaged Cp data. The study is performed using published empirical data on pressure coefficients obtained from extensive wind tunnel experiments. The uncertainty is assessed based on the comparison of the airflow rate (ϕ) calculated using the surface-averaged Cp values (ϕAV) and the airflow rate calculated using local Cp values (ϕLOC). The results indicate that the uncertainty with a confidence interval of 95{\%} is high: 0.23 ϕAV{\textless}ϕLOC{\textless}5.07 ϕAV. In cases with the largest surface-averaged $\Delta$Cp, the underestimation or overestimation is smaller but not negligible: 0.52 ϕAV{\textless}ϕLOC{\textless}1.42 ϕAV. These results provide boundaries for future improvements in Cp data quality, and new developments can be evaluated by comparison with the uncertainty of the current methods.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to combine sensitivity analysis and simulation-based optimisation in order to optimise the thermal and energy performance of residential buildings in the Argentine Littoral region. An actual house was selected as case study. This is a typical, local, single-family house having some rooms conditioned only by natural ventilation, and other rooms with natural ventilation supplemented by mechanical air-conditioning (hybrid ventilation). Hence, the total degree-hours at the naturally ventilated living room and the total energy consumption by air-conditioning at the bedrooms were chosen as objective functions to be minimised. The global objective function characterising the thermal and energy performance of the house was defined as the weighted sum of these objective functions. This objective function was computed using the EnergyPlus building performance simulation programme. Then, we performed a sensitivity analysis using the Morris screening method to rank the influence of the design variables on the objective function. This showed that the type of external walls, the windows infiltration rate and the solar azimuth were the most influential design variables on the given objective function for the considered house, and also that the azimuth either had a highly nonlinear effect on the objective function or was highly correlated to the others variables, deserving in any case a finer discretisation. Finally, we solved an optimisation problem using genetic algorithms in order to find the optimal set of design variables for the considered house. The results highlighted the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed methodology to redesign a typical house in the Argentine Littoral region, improving hugely its thermal and energy performance.},

abstract = {Since an important part of the world's energy is used for space cooling and heating of buildings, its minimization has great energy saving potential. Heat exchange between buildings and surrounding environment is due to convective and radiative heat flows. In this study a detailed building energy simulation (BES) has been carried out in order to analyze the effect of neighbouring buildings on these heat flows and in order to quantify mutual influence on the space cooling and heating demand of buildings. BESs were conducted for a stand-alone building and for a building situated in a typical street canyon. This study demonstrates the importance of considering the urban microclimate conditions for the prediction of the energy demand of buildings. With the implemented model most of the thermal effects of the urban microclimate can be modeled and quantified on a street canyon scale. Due to multiple reflections higher values of solar and thermal radiation are absorbed at the fa{\c{c}}ades of buildings in street canyons than those that occur at stand-alone buildings fa{\c{c}}ades. These effects cause higher surface temperatures in street canyons which means higher space cooling and lower space heating demands. Other reasons that cause this phenomenon are the lower convective heat transfer coefficients in street canyons that results in a reduction of the heat removal from street canyons and contribute to plump the urban heat island effect.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor  {\&}  Francis. ASHRAE Standard 55 is widely used to assess thermal comfort in buildings worldwide. The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate the adaptive method application proposed by ASHRAE 55 in two different climates in Brazil. This method relates the conditions for comfort to the "prevailing mean outdoor air temperature". The currently available version of the Standard allows for linear and exponential methods to calculate the "prevailing mean", and both are tested to establish the acceptability zones. The results indicate that choosing any of the methods to calculate the prevailing mean outdoor air temperature gives similar results when the temperature amplitudes are small; but it can lead to different limits of acceptability, and consequently sum of discomfort hours, when significant day-to-day temperature variations are present. In addition, the results indicate that it is possible to find significant percentages of thermal acceptability from previous studies below the lower limit of acceptability proposed by the Standard. As a result, a "clo adjustment zone" is suggested.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. The aim of this work is to assess the use of mixed-mode ventilation for a typical office building in Lebanon and consequently reduce Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption in the observed current and under the future projected climatic conditions. Mixed-mode cooling is considered a compromise between the insufficient natural ventilation and the expensive year round-operated HVAC. A control algorithm is set for windows and HVAC system to ensure mixed-mode operation. Dynamic simulations are performed on a typical office building in Beirut City under the mixed-mode operation in the present and the future using commercial IES-VE software. The results of the software were validated against measured HVAC and total energy consumption of the typical office base case with conventional mechanical system. The results of the simulations are evaluated in terms of potential reduction in energy consumption under the present and the future weather data. Finally, a lifecycle cost analysis is performed for the proposed system, and its payback period is computed. Under present construction practices and weather data, 31{\%} annual energy savings were achieved using mixed-mode system. Under future 2050s projected weather data, annual energy savings of 21{\%} was attained with a payback period of 3.8 years.},

abstract = {The use of urban vegetation in cities is a common landscape planning strategy to alleviate the heat island effect as well as to enhance building energy efficiency. The presence of trees in street canyons can effectively reduce environmental temperature via radiative shading. However, resolving shade trees in urban land surface models presents a major challenge in numerical models, especially in predicting the radiative heat exchange in canyons. In this paper, we develop a new numerical framework by incorporating shade trees into an advanced single-layer urban canopy model. This novel numerical framework is applied to Phoenix metropolitan area to investigate the cooling effect of different urban vegetation types and their potentials in saving building energy. It is found that the cooling effect by shading from trees is more significant than that by evapotranspiration from lawns, leading to a considerable saving of cooling load. In addition, analysis of human thermal comfort shows that urban vegetation plays a crucial role in creating a comfortable living environment, especially for cities located in arid or semi-arid region.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. Natural ventilation (NV) is a relevant passive strategy for the design of buildings in seek of energy savings and the improvement of the indoor air quality and the thermal comfort. The main aim of this work is to present a comprehensive NV modeling study of a non-rectangular floor-plan dwelling. Given the arbitrary shape of the building, recourse is made to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to determine the surface-averaged pressure coefficients (Cp¯). The CFD model was calibrated to match experimental data from an extensive wind tunnel database for low-rise buildings. Then, Cp¯ computation via CFD is used to feed the building performance simulation software EnergyPlus, in replacement of the built-in Swami and Chandra parametric model that is only valid for estimating Cp¯ in rectangular floor-plan buildings. This computational tool is used to investigate the effect of NV on the thermal performance and the airflow rate in a social housing located in the Argentine Littoral region. Simulation results of the considered building show that NV enables to reduce even more than 65{\%} of the cooling degree-hours. Furthermore, regarding to the Cp¯ source (either CFD or Swami and Chandra's), it is also found that this data has a considerable effect on the airflow rates, but a little effect on the thermal performance.},

We performed uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to determine which design parameters have most impact on the uncertainty associated with ventilation performance predictions. Using the results of the field study along with wind-tunnel measurements and other detailed analysis, we incrementally improved our early-design-stage model. The improved model's natural ventilation performance predictions were significantly more accurate than those of the first draft early-stage-design model that employed model assumptions typical during initial design. This process highlighted significant limitations in the EnergyPlus software's models of occupant-driven window control. We conclude with recommendations on key design parameters including window control, wind pressure coefficients and weather data resolution to help improve early-design-stage predictions of natural ventilation performance using EnergyPlus.},

In this paper, the field measurements results are presented on the stack ventilation effect in a configuration with multi-chimneys which interact with tilted pivot windows. A residential two-family detached house was chosen to perform the measurement campaign. The house was located in a cold climate region in northern Poland. The measurements were performed in June during the time period of transient climate conditions between spring and summer. Local climate conditions, indoor climate conditions and air velocities in vent inlets and outlets were measured. In order to interpret measurement results, a modified model of a tilted pivot window with an axis at the bottom was proposed, based on a model used in single-sided ventilation investigations. The measured results confirmed the usefulness of the proposed approach. The loss coefficient (discharge coefficient) of 0.345 was lower than the loss coefficient of 0.60, usually assumed for small rectangular openings during natural ventilation. In the absence of wind when the stack effect acted only, the air changes per hour slightly exceeded the standard minimum value. The tilted window leeward wind significantly reduced the stack effect and ACH.},

Dynamic simulations for a typical office room in the five representative cities, which are Harbin, Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming and Guangzhou, have been carried out. The study demonstrates that the NVCP depends on the multiple impacts of climate, the building's thermal characteristics, internal gains, ventilation profiles and regimes. The work shows how the simplified method can be used to generate detailed, indoor, operative temperature data based on the various building conditions and control profiles which are used to investigate the NVCP at the strategic design stage.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V. Buildings are a significant contributor to the rapidly increasing electricity demand in Egypt which is straining the existing supply network causing economic and social impacts. There are current initiatives aimed at improved building performance including adoption of international standards. The performance of existing Egyptian buildings is not well understood making the impact of these international standards uncertain. This paper provides insight into performance of current Egyptian office buildings through a multi-building energy survey and a detailed case study. The most common office type in the survey has natural ventilation and local cooling. A process to capture observed performance in a representative model and input parameter set is presented. The model is used to investigate performance impacts of parameters including: location, weather, building envelope, intensity of occupancy, behaviour, and installed systems including the HVAC strategy. HVAC strategy was identified as the most significant factor. Typical Egyptian offices with natural ventilation and local cooling systems under personal control have electricity demand less than 50{\%} of centrally serviced buildings. System efficiencies (HVAC, lights, equipment) and occupant behaviour (e.g. use of systems, temperatures) were also identified as significant factors, each with potential of around 30{\%} saving compared to current typical offices. Possible policy measures to promote energy efficient systems and energy conscious behaviour are proposed which together can reduce the energy demand of typical offices by 50{\%}. Trade-offs between energy use and indoor environmental quality (IEQ) are discussed.},

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis plays an important role in building energy analysis. It can be used to identify the key variables affecting building thermal performance from both energy simulation models and observational study. This paper is focused on the application of sensitivity analysis in the field of building performance analysis. First, the typical steps of implementation of sensitivity analysis in building analysis are described. A number of practical issues in applying sensitivity analysis are also discussed, such as the determination of input variations, the choice of building energy programs, how to reduce computational time for energy models. Second, the sensitivity analysis methods used in building performance analysis are reviewed. These methods can be categorized into local and global sensitivity analysis. The global methods can be further divided into four approaches: regression, screening-based, variance-based, and meta-model sensitivity analysis. Recent research has been concentrated on global methods because they can explore the whole input space and most of them allow the self-verification, i.e., how much variance of the model output (building energy consumption) has been explained by the method used in the analysis. Third, we discuss several important topics, which are often overlooked in the domain of building performance analysis. These topics include the application of sensitivity analysis in observational study, how to deal with correlated inputs, the computation of the variations of sensitivity index, and the software issues. Lastly, the practical guidance is given based on the advantages and disadvantaged of different sensitivity analysis methods in assessing building thermal performance. The recommendations for further research in the future are made to provide more robust analysis in assessing building energy performance.},

abstract = {The airflow network (AFN) modeling approach provides an attractive balance between the accuracy and computational demand for naturally ventilated buildings. Its accuracy depends on input parameters such as wind pressure and opening discharge coefficients. In most cases, these parameters are obtained from secondary sources which are solely representative for very simplified buildings, i.e. for buildings without facade details. Although studies comparing wind pressure coefficients or discharge coefficients from different sources exist, the knowledge regarding the effect of input data on AFN is still poor. In this paper, the influence of wind pressure data on the accuracy of a coupled AFN-BES model for a real building with natural wind- and stack-driven ventilation was analyzed. The results of 8 computation cases with different wind pressure data from secondary sources were compared with the measured data. Both the indoor temperatures and the airflow were taken into account. The outcomes indicated that the source of wind pressure data had a significant influence on the model performance.},

abstract = {The building sector has a significant share in a county's total greenhouse gas emissions, and as a reaction to the Kyoto commitment most countries are constantly adjusting building energy requirements in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the climate change. While it is easier to set standards for the building fabric and for technical systems, the impact of occupants on comfort and energy performance in buildings has proven to be important, but is a lot harder to account for. This paper therefore aims to investigate the magnitude of influence of occupants in relation to climate and architectural design on thermal comfort and CO2 emissions in offices in different climate zones of the world. The aim is to identify typical patterns and key parameters for optimisation. For this purpose, a parametric study for a typical cellular office room has been conducted using the simulation software EnergyPlus. Two different occupant scenarios are each compared with three different architectural design variations and modelled in the context of three different locations for the IPCC climate change scenario A2 for 2030. The evaluation of the results is focused on two different modes of operation. For natural ventilation adaptive thermal comfort according to ASHRAE Standard 55 has been evaluated, and for mixed mode operation final energy consumption and resulting CO2 emissions. The results indicate a first approach to estimate comfort levels based on climatic data, architectural design priorities and occupancy. Additionally, warmer climates seem to have larger optimisation potential for comfort and energy performance in offices compared to colder climates.},

abstract = {Wind pressure coefficients (Cp) are influenced by a wide range of parameters, including building geometry, facade detailing, position on the facade, the degree of exposure/sheltering, wind speed and wind direction. As it is practically impossible to take into account the full complexity of pressure coefficient variation, building energy simulation (BES) and Airflow network (AFN) programs generally incorporate it in a simplified way. This paper provides an overview of pressure coefficient data and the extent to which they are currently implemented in BES–AFN programs. A distinction is made between primary sources of Cp data, such as full-scale measurements, reduced-scale measurements in wind tunnels and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, and secondary sources, such as databases and analytical models. The comparison between data from secondary sources implemented in BES–AFN programs shows that the Cp values are quite different depending on the source adopted. The two influencing parameters for which these differences are most pronounced are the position on the facade and the degree of exposure/sheltering. The comparison of Cp data from different sources for sheltered buildings shows the largest differences, and data from different sources even present different trends. The paper concludes that quantification of the uncertainty related to such data sources is required to guide future improvements in Cp implementation in BES–AFN programs.},

abstract = {Energy consumption in the building sector is a major concern, especially in tropical climates where high temperatures and humidity force occupants to use electro-mechanical ventilation. Passive design strategies, in particular the application of natural ventilation, are one of the main techniques to moderate temperatures in buildings. Furthermore, many studies have shown reduced operating costs, better thermal comfort and indoor air quality, to be some of the advantages of the application of natural ventilation in buildings. Although existing studies support the efficiency of natural ventilation, the efficiency and practicability of architectural elements to maximise ventilation in buildings remains problematic. This study reviews studies on natural ventilation with other passive design strategies in tropical climates in order to support the argument for the application of natural ventilation in tropical climates. Through a review of studies on the operation of natural ventilation in buildings, it also identifies the most effective architectural elements and techniques in building fa{\c{c}}ades and ventilation openings. The results indicate that ventilation shafts, window-to-wall ratio and building orientation should be applied in future construction. This study also identifies some further specific elements that are worth further investigation, including the shape of louvered windows, different forms of apertures and vernacular elements.},

abstract = {Use of centre-pivot roof windows is very common in single family houses in Nordic Europe. Unfortunately the wind-driven airflow characteristics of this kind of windows are missing in the scientific literature. In the present study, the airflow rate through the window was specified by using the discharge coefficient. Wind tunnel measurements using a modelled centre-pivot roof window was used in the present study. For smaller sash opening angles the value of discharge coefficient was approaching unity and the discharge coefficient decreased with increase in the sash opening angle. The value of 0.6 was only obtained when the window was without sash. Hence, the inclusion of sash improved the airflow characteristics of the window due to increased value of the discharge coefficient. The discharge coefficient also depended on turbulence in the flow. In the absence of external wind, the turbulence was described by the value of Re. Only for higher values of Re the still-air discharge coefficients became independent of the flow direction and the air velocity. Whereas for wind driven natural ventilation the ratio of average air speed within the opening and the reference wind speed (velocity ratio) was used to define the fully developed turbulent flow. Constant values of wind-driven discharge coefficients were obtained when the average air speed within the opening was equal to or greater than the reference wind speed i.e. the velocity ratio greater than unity. Moreover, when the velocity ratio was greater than unity, the still-air discharge coefficients became identical to the wind-driven discharge coefficients.},

abstract = {Energy demand in cooling-dominant climates can be reduced by implementation of natural ventilation as a passive cooling strategy. Accordingly, suitable evaluation and prediction tools are requirements for effectively introducing natural ventilation in building design. In addition, the rapid emergence of multi-storey buildings can accelerate energy consumption, especially in cases of inappropriate building design. This study, therefore, proposes a process model for the better integration and evaluation of natural ventilation design into the overall building design process for multi-storey buildings. To achieve this, available methods of natural ventilation evaluation were identified through a literature review and classified into three main categories: analytical and empirical methods, computational simulations, and experimental methods. Strengths and limitations of each method are then evaluated with regards to accuracy of the results, cost, applicability to complex geometries, resolution of results, and time cost. Finally, a process model was proposed based on the methods' advantages and limitations, as well as needs of each design stage and recommends the most suitable integration of natural ventilation evaluation methods into the overall design process.},

The metamodels represent the thermal behavior of naturally ventilated and artificially air-conditioned residential buildings. A computational simulation experiment using the EnergyPlus program was conducted taking into account naturally ventilated and artificially air-conditioned residential buildings. Several parameters were considered for parametric simulations such as thermal transmittance, thermal solar absorptance, shading device, ventilation opening factor. The multi-linear regression method was used to predict the cooling degree hours and the annual energy consumption for heating and cooling for dormitories and living room. An assessment on the accuracy of the Brazilian metamodels for residential buildings was analyzed and showed that the regressions include standard errors that may influence the metamodels accuracy. Therefore, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are presented as an alternative to improve the metamodels used in the Brazilian regulation. Comparing both statistical method multi-linear regression and artificial neural network method it can be seen that ANN presented lower results for standard deviation end root mean square errors. Therefore, ANNs are recommended to improve the accuracy of the prediction in further behavior associated with the labeling system.},

In response to swift changes in the building industry, and the need to evaluate impacts of design decisions for energy-efficiency and legislation, universities are introducing training initiatives in building performance simulation (BPS) for building design decision-making. This work aims to identify and discuss prevalent paradigms used to teach BPS. Through a comprehensive and critical literature review, three paradigms are found: training the simulation ‘expert' and training the architecture student to become either a ‘consumer' or ‘performer' of simulations. Examples from the literature are presented to illustrate each paradigm, followed by a discussion of where trainees of each paradigm would be situated in practical project environments. Recognizing these paradigms serves as a foundation to set up future teaching initiatives and research in this area. However, there is a need for members of both architecture and BPS communities to work together towards harmonizing distinguishing features of each paradigm, to fully exploit the potentials offered by them.},

abstract = {Studies have demonstrated the energy savings potential of mixed-mode ventilated office buildings. Yet, it is important to widen the knowledge about how those buildings have been designed and built in practice, and which design parameters have greater influence on its energy performance. The aim of this paper was to evaluate how building envelope design parameters influence the energy performance of cellular mixed-mode office buildings, in order to identify key design variables. The analysis presents a comparison among literature research studies and typical construction practices from a sample of buildings located in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. According to a base case model, established based on the real buildings sample, three sensitivity analysis techniques were performed to obtain relative parameter sensitivity to thermal loads: OFAT, Morris and Monte Carlo. Results showed the importance of the window opening effective area and the reduced impact of the window-to-wall ratio on the energy performance of mixed-mode office buildings. By applying a multivariate regression model, it showed significant in predicting 78.1{\%} of the variance in annual thermal loads. The accurate determination of annual thermal loads into mixed-mode office buildings can be used to optimize the envelope characteristics based on a combination of input data and the building geometry. Findings from this study could also be applied to other locations, provided that similar climatic environment and urban context are taken into account.},

abstract = {Different types of phase-change materials (PCMs) have been tested as dynamic components in buildings during the last four decades. Most historical studies have found that PCMs enhance building energy performance. Some PCM-enhanced building materials, like PCM-gypsum boards or PCM-impregnated concretes, have already found limited applications in different coun- tries. Today, continued improvements in building envelope technologies suggest that throughout southern and central US climates, residences may soon be routinely constructed with PCM in order to maximize insulation effectiveness and maintain low heating and cooling loads. This paper presents experimental and numerical results from thermal performance studies. These studies focus on blown fiberglass insulation modified with a novel spray-applied microencapsulated PCM. Experimental results are reported for both laboratory-scale and full-sized building elements tested in the field. In order to confirm theoretical predictions, PCM- enhanced fiberglass insulation was evaluated in a guarded hot-box facility to demonstrate heat flow reductions when one side of a test wall is subjected to a temperature increase. The laboratory work showed reductions in heat flow of 30{\%} due to the presence of approximately 20 wt {\%} PCM in the insulation. Field testing of residential attics insulated with blown fiberglass and PCM was completed in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Experimental work was followed by detailed whole building EnergyPlus simulations in order to generate energy performance data for different US climates. In addition, a series of numerical simulations and field experiments demonstrated a potential for application of a novel PCM fiberglass insulation as enabling technology to be used during the attic thermal renovations},

The location of an analytical office building model is selected in Beijing area.

EnergyPlus software issued by U.S.A is employed to do the simulation of building cooling load in summer. The effect analysis of different combination of all affecting factors has been done by orthogonal experimental method. From this work, the changing trend of cooling load of a typical office building with the change of each affecting factor can be obtained and presented. The optimal combination scheme of the affecting factors with the minimum building cooling load can also be obtained. Furthermore, the affecting notability of each affecting factor can be analyzed and selected. These works are very important to give us a guidance to do a building design that has the characteristics of high energy efficiency and low energy consumption. In this paper, a comparison analysis of summer cooling load among three typical office room patterns in Beijing has been also done.},

abstract = {In biospectroscopy, suitably annotated and statistically independent samples (e.g. patients, batches, etc.) for classifier training and testing are scarce and costly. Learning curves show the model performance as function of the training sample size and can help to determine the sample size needed to train good classifiers. However, building a good model is actually not enough: the performance must also be proven. We discuss learning curves for typical small sample size situations with 5-25 independent samples per class. Although the classification models achieve acceptable performance, the learning curve can be completely masked by the random testing uncertainty due to the equally limited test sample size. In consequence, we determine test sample sizes necessary to achieve reasonable precision in the validation and find that 75-100 samples will usually be needed to test a good but not perfect classifier. Such a data set will then allow refined sample size planning on the basis of the achieved performance. We also demonstrate how to calculate necessary sample sizes in order to show the superiority of one classifier over another: this often requires hundreds of statistically independent test samples or is even theoretically impossible. We demonstrate our findings with a data set of ca. 2550 Raman spectra of single cells (five classes: erythrocytes, leukocytes and three tumour cell lines BT-20, MCF-7 and OCI-AML3) as well as by an extensive simulation that allows precise determination of the actual performance of the models in question. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Building performance simulations (BPS) are used to test different designs and systems with the intention of reducing building costs and energy demand while ensuring a comfortable indoor climate. Unfortunately, software for BPS is computationally intensive. This makes it impractical to run thousands of simulations for sensitivity analysis and optimization. Worse yet, millions of simulations may be necessary for a thorough exploration of the high-dimensional design space formed by the many design parameters. This computational issue may be overcome by the creation of fast metamodels. In this paper, we aim to find suitable metamodeling techniques for diverse outputs from BPS. We consider five indicators of building performance and eight test problems for the comparison six popular metamodeling techniques – linear regression with ordinary least squares (OLS), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), multivariate adaptive regression splines, Gaussian process regression (GPR), and neural network (NN). The methods are compared with respect to accuracy, efficiency, ease-of-use, robustness, and interpretability. To conduct a fair and in-depth comparison, a methodological approach is pursued using exhaustive grid searches for model selection assisted by sensitivity analysis. The comparison shows that GPR produces the most accurate metamodels, followed by NN and MARS. GPR is robust and easy to implement but becomes inefficient for large training sets compared to NN and MARS. A coefficient of determination, R2, larger than 0.9 have been obtained for the BPS outputs using between 128 and 1024 training points. In contrast, accurate metamodels with R2values larger than 0.99 can be achieved for all eight test problems using only 32–256 training points.},

abstract = {This paper examines collaborative relationships between architects and energy consultants, for the uptake and use of building performance simulation (BPS). BPS is thought to hold massive potential for the AEC industry, by allowing professionals to quantify impacts of architectural design-decisions. However, a number of technical barriers are widely-cited in the literature preventing the uptake of these tools. Instead, many architects collaborate with consultants for BPS uptake. It is hereby proposed that alongside technical barriers, additional non-technical barriers may arise when architects and consultants collaborate as a consequence of worldview differences. To enable exploration of potential barriers, the context of BPS is observed from a social lens focusing on the human dimension of interaction. Qualitative methods from the social sciences are used to extract some barriers; and a quantitative follow-up is performed to ascertain whether extracted barriers are similarly perceived amongst a larger sample of architects and consultants. Barriers identified include: negotiating control over decision-making, differences in problem-solving approaches, cliental roles and regulatory frameworks, professional trust and communication. Identification of these barriers constitutes a starting point to advance BPS research, encouraging a deeper examination of the social contexts in which BPS is used.},

abstract = {Traditional benchmarking of building energy performance usually starts by considering a wide range of different factors and giving these factors different weights to help reach one general indicator measuring a building's overall energy performance. For obtaining more specific information in building energy management performance, this paper proposes an adjustment to the traditional approach by using climate classification and data envelopment analysis (DEA). The study first adopts cluster analysis to classify the evaluated buildings into different climate clusters. Secondly, scale factors are identified by regression analysis. DEA is then employed to assess the energy management efficiency of the evaluated buildings. The samples of 122 office buildings in Taiwan in summer are classified into three climate clusters (warm and long rain hour, hot and middle rain hour, and hot and short rain hour). Research results indicate that the average indicators of energy management performance in each of the three climate clusters are 0.5, 0.56, and 0.56 respectively. The lower value indicator of energy management performance, resulted from the comparison between the energy consumption of the evaluated building and the minimum energy consumption among buildings in the same scale and similar climate conditions, indicates a more potential in energy saving. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The majority of published sensitivity analyses (SAs) are either local or one factor-at-a-time (OAT) analyses, relying on unjustified assumptions of model linearity and additivity. Global approaches to sensitivity analyses (GSA) which would obviate these shortcomings, are applied by a minority of researchers. By reviewing the academic literature on SA, we here present a bibliometric analysis of the trends of different SA practices in last decade. The review has been conducted both on some top ranking journals (Nature and Science) and through an extended analysis in the Elsevier's Scopus database of scientific publications. After correcting for the global growth in publications, the amount of papers performing a generic SA has notably increased over the last decade. Even if OAT is still the most largely used technique in SA, there is a clear increase in the use of GSA with preference respectively for regression and variance-based techniques. Even after adjusting for the growth of publications in the sole modelling field, to which SA and GSA normally apply, the trend is confirmed. Data about regions of origin and discipline are also briefly discussed. The results above are confirmed when zooming on the sole articles published in chemical modelling, a field historically proficient in the use of SA methods.},

abstract = {One of the most discussed issues in the design community is the performance gap. In this research, we investigate for the first time whether part of the gap might be caused by the modelling literacy of design teams. A total of 108 building modellers were asked to comment on the importance of obtaining and using accurate values for 21 common modelling input variables, from U-values to occupancy schedules when using dynamic simulation to estimate annual energy demand. The questioning was based on a real building for which high-resolution energy, occupancy and temperature data were recorded. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted using a model of the building (based on the measured data) by perturbing one parameter in each simulation. The effect of each perturbation on the annual energy consumption given by the model was found and a ranked list generated. The order of this list was then compared to that given by the modellers for the same changes in the parameters. A correlation analysis indicated little correlation between which variables were thought to be important by the modellers and which proved to be objectively important. k-means cluster analysis identified subgroups of modellers and showed that 25{\%} of the people tested were making judgements that appeared worse than a person responding at random. Follow-up checks showed that higher level qualifications, or having many years of experience in modelling, did not improve the accuracy of people's predictions. In addition, there was no correlation between modellers, with many ranking some parameters as important that others thought irrelevant. Using a three-part definition of literacy, it is concluded that this sample of modellers, and by implication the population of building modellers, cannot be considered modelling literate. This indicates a new cause of the performance gap. The results suggest a need and an opportunity for both industry and universities to increase their efforts with respect to building physics education, and if this is done, a part of the performance gap could be rapidly closed. Practical application: In any commercial simulation, the modeller will have to decide which parameters must be included and which might be ignored due to lack of time and/or data, and how much any approximations might perturb the results. In this paper, the judgment of 108 modellers was compared against each other. The results show that the internal mental models of thermal modellers disagree with one another, and disagree with the results of a validated thermal model. The lessons learnt will be of great utility to modellers, and those educating the next generation of modellers.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.In modern building design, engineers are constantly facing challenging to find an optimal design to maintain a high level of thermal comfort and indoor air quality for occupants while minimizing the system energy consumption. Over the past decades, several algorithms have been proposed and developed for optimizing the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system for indoor environment. Nevertheless, majority of these optimization algorithms are focused on single objective optimization procedures and require large training sample for surrogate modelling. For multi-objective HVAC design problems, previous studies introduced an arbitrary weighting factor to combine all design objectives into one single objective function. The near optimal solutions were however sensitive to the chosen value of the weighting factor. Aiming to develop a multi-objective optimization platform with minimal computational cost, this paper presents a nondominated sorting-based particle swarm optimization (NSPSO) algorithm together with the Kriging method to perform optimization for the HVAC system design of a typical office room. In addition, an adaptive sampling procedure is also proposed to enable the optimization platform to adjust the sampling point and resolution in constructing the training sample. Significant computational cost could be reduced without sacrificing the accuracy of the optimal solution. The proposed methods are applied and assessed in a typical HVAC system and the results indicate that comparing to traditional methods, the presented approach can handle multi-objective optimization in ventilation system with up to 46.6{\%} saving of computational time.},

@article{Masoso2010a,
abstract = {While most studies focus on energy savings during occupied hours, this paper shows the shocking quantities of energy wasted during non-occupied hours in commercial buildings. At least five detailed energy audits were carried out in the hot and dry climates of Botswana and South Africa. The work shows that more energy is used during non-working hours (56{\%}) than during working hours (44{\%}). This arises largely from occupants' behaviour of leaving lights and equipment on at the end of the day, and partly due to poor zoning and controls. There is a crying need for building occupants to learn to switch off what they do not use. The golden rule is: “If you don't need it, don't use it!” This is the simplest and cheapest lesson with amongst the biggest savings. Apart from the above, the work also contributes to several other fields of scientific research: it helps in development of benchmarks from sub-hourly field data; it contributes apportionment of energy amongst sub-systems of HVAC, lighting and office equipment; it provides a picture from cooling dominated climates, which normally differs from the largely researched heating dominated climates; it contributes to development of diversity profiles necessary for improvement of simulation accuracy.},

abstract = {This work presents the literature review of the methods used to model the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The model development is necessary for the study of the energy consumption of HVAC systems. Models are also required to simulate the different supervisory and local loop control strategies to improve the energy consumption efficiency. HVAC systems have complex structures consisting of heat and mass transfer equipment such as chiller, boiler, heating/cooling coils, and supply air ducts. HVAC systems also consist of several sensors and controllers for regulating the controllable variables such as zone temperature, supply air temperature, supply air fan speed, duct static pressure, and chilled water temperature at their set-points. To predict the energy consumption by the HVAC systems accurately, one needs to model the individual components either from the measured data or based on the knowledge of the underlying physical phenomenon. This results in three broad classes of the models known as data driven, physics based, and grey box models. In this paper, major data driven, physics based, and grey box modeling techniques reported in the recent literature are reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The BEESTs were used to improve the energy performance of exterior walls, roof and exterior windows.

abstract = {Building performance simulation (BPS) has the potential to provide relevant design information by indicating directions for design solutions. A major challenge in simulation tools is how to deal with difficulties through large variety of parameters and complexity of factors such as non-linearity, discreteness, and uncertainty. The purpose of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis can be described as identifying uncertainties in input and output of a system or simulation tool [1-3]. In practice uncertainty and sensitivity analysis have many additional benefits including: (1) With the help of parameter screening it enables the simplification of a model [4]. (2) It allows the analysis of the robustness of a model [5]. (3) It makes aware of unexpected sensitivities that may lead to errors and/or wrong specifications (quality assurance) [6-10]. (4) By changing the input of the parameters and showing the effect on the outcome of a model, it provides a "what-if analysis" (decision support). [11]. In this paper a case study is performed based on an office building with respect to various building performance parameters. Uncertainty analysis (UA) is carried out and implications for the results considering energy consumption and thermal comfort are demonstrated and elaborated. The added value and usefulness of the integration of UA in BPS is shown. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Recently, very high electric energy consumption, used for air-conditioning loads, is reached during summer days. Insulation of building walls is recently applied with an insulation layer thickness typically ranging between 4 cm and 5 cm, regardless of the climatic conditions, type and cost of insulation material and other economic parameters. In the present study, an optimum insulation thickness is determined under steady periodic conditions. An analytical method, based on Complex Finite Fourier Transform (CFFT), is extended to rigorously estimate the yearly cooling transmission loads for two types of insulation materials and two typical wall structures. Estimated loads are used as inputs to a life-cycle cost analysis in order to determine the optimum thickness of the insulation layer. Results show that, the most profitable case is the stone/brick sandwich wall and expanded polystyrene for insulation, with an optimum thickness of 5.7 cm. In this case, energy savings up to 58{\%} are achieved with a payback period of 3.11 years. The thermal performance of the walls under optimal conditions is also investigated. Then, comparison of the present study with the degree-days method is performed for different values of indoor design temperature. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to combine sensitivity analysis and simulation-based optimisation in order to optimise the thermal and energy performance of residential buildings in the Argentine Littoral region. An actual house was selected as case study. This is a typical, local, single-family house having some rooms conditioned only by natural ventilation, and other rooms with natural ventilation supplemented by mechanical air-conditioning (hybrid ventilation). Hence, the total degree-hours at the naturally ventilated living room and the total energy consumption by air-conditioning at the bedrooms were chosen as objective functions to be minimised. The global objective function characterising the thermal and energy performance of the house was defined as the weighted sum of these objective functions. This objective function was computed using the EnergyPlus building performance simulation programme. Then, we performed a sensitivity analysis using the Morris screening method to rank the influence of the design variables on the objective function. This showed that the type of external walls, the windows infiltration rate and the solar azimuth were the most influential design variables on the given objective function for the considered house, and also that the azimuth either had a highly nonlinear effect on the objective function or was highly correlated to the others variables, deserving in any case a finer discretisation. Finally, we solved an optimisation problem using genetic algorithms in order to find the optimal set of design variables for the considered house. The results highlighted the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed methodology to redesign a typical house in the Argentine Littoral region, improving hugely its thermal and energy performance.},

Seven US cities are studied to represent a range of ambient temperature amplitudes.

Innovative retrofitting solutions can involve the adoption of Phase Change Materials (PCMs), but an effective use of PCM in buildings requires an appropriate selection of the thermo-physical properties, quantity and position of the PCMs. To guarantee a good functioning of a PCM and ensure economic feasibility, an optimisation of PCM use is advisable. In the present paper, multi-objective optimisation analyses for the energy retrofitting of office buildings with PCM-enhanced opaque building envelope components are presented. A retrofitting intervention on either the external or internal side of the opaque envelope was considered, and a maximum of two PCM layers with different melting temperatures were selected and placed in different positions within the wall. Two sets of objective functions were minimised; first, primary energy consumption and global costs, and then the building energy needs for heating and cooling and investment costs. The search variables included the thickness and thermo-physical properties of the PCM layers, the window type, the insulation and internal lining materials, the wall configuration and U-value. In order to provide a robust methodology to drive designers towards an informed choice of the final retrofitting strategy, post-optimisation analyses were additionally carried out to investigate the variable values that led to the optimal solutions. Interesting and non-trivial information was obtained. The optimal thermo-physical properties of PCMs were found to be affected in particular by the operation of the HVAC system.},

abstract = {High levels of energy consumption in residential buildings and global warming are important issues. Thus the energy performance of buildings should be improved in the early stages of design. This article describes an approach for developing guidelines on sensitive and robust design parameters for the present, the 2020s, the 2050s and the 2080s. Such guidelines can help architects to design low-rise apartment buildings that require less energy for various purposes, such as heating or cooling. The article consists of a general literature review, interviews with architects, the generation of case-specific information and a mock-up presentation and a meeting with professionals. An example guideline that aims to reduce annual cooling energy loads under global warming in low-rise apartment buildings located in hot-humid climates is presented to demonstrate how the proposed approach can be applied. For this guideline, case-specific information was generated, and a global sensitivity analysis based on Monte Carlo Analysis and the Latin Hypercube Sampling technique was performed. The results show that the suggested approach is feasible and could be used to provide helpful information to architects during the design of low-rise apartment buildings with high energy performance. The most sensitive design parameters that affect annual cooling energy loads in low-rise apartment buildings were natural ventilation, window area, and the solar heat-gain coefficient (SHGC) of the glazing. The results are relevant for the present, the 2020s, the 2050s and the 2080s. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Occupants interact with buildings in various ways via their presence (passive effects) and control actions (active effects). Therefore, understanding the influence of occupants is essential if we are to evaluate the performance of a building. In this paper, we model the mean profiles and variability of occupancy variables (presence and actions) separately. We will use a multi-variate Gaussian distribution to generate mean profiles of occupancy variables, while the variability will be represented by a multi-dimensional time series model, within a framework for a meta-analysis that synthesizes occupancy data gathered from a pool of buildings. We then discuss variants of occupancy models with respect to various outcomes of interest such as HVAC energy consumption and peak demand behavior via a sensitivity analysis. Results show that our approach is able to generate stochastic occupancy profiles, requiring minimum additional input from the energy modeler other than standard diversity profiles. Along with the meta-analysis, we enable the generalization of previous research results and statistical inferences to choose occupancy variables for future buildings. The sensitivity analysis shows that for aggregated building energy consumption, occupant presence has a smaller impact compared to lighting and appliance usage. Specifically, being accumulatively 55{\%} wrong with regard to presence, only translates to 2{\%} error in aggregated cooling energy in July and 3.6{\%} error in heating energy in January. Such a finding redirects focus to the accurate estimation of lighting and appliance usage for a better prediction of aggregated energy consumption. Furthermore, it proves that accurate knowledge of the mean profiles is sufficient, that is, stochastic occupancy models do not play a significant role in the prediction of aggregated consumption in a conventional office building where the interaction between the operation of building systems and the spatial and temporal variability of occupancy is weak. When it comes to peak demand behavior, occupancy variability should be taken into account, as static profiles are not able to produce adequate estimates of power duration probabilities close to the power peak.},

abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different " thinned " networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

abstract = {Building performance is influenced by occupants' presence and actions. Knowledge of occupants' future presence and behaviour in buildings is of central importance to the implementation efforts concerning predictive building systems control strategies. Specifically, prediction of occupants' presence in office buildings represents a necessary condition for predicting their interactions with building systems. In the present contribution, we focus on the evaluation of a number of occupancy models to explore the potential of monitored past occupancy data towards predicting future presence of occupants. Towards this end, we obtained long-term high-resolution monitored occupancy data from a number of workplaces (in open, semi-open, and closed office settings) in a university building. Using this data, we trained two existing probabilistic occupancy models and an original non-probabilistic occupancy model to predict the occupancy profiles of the same workplaces on a daily basis. The predictions were evaluated via comparison with monitored daily occupancy profiles. To conduct the model evaluation in a rigorous manner, separate sets of data were used to train and evaluate the models. A set of five specific evaluation statistics was deployed for model comparison. In general, the obtained level of predictive accuracy of all models considered was found to be rather low. However, the proposed non-probabilistic model performed better in view of short-term occupancy predictions. The results thus facilitate a discussion of the potential and limitations of predicting building occupants' future presence patterns based on past monitoring data.},

abstract = {Climatic zoning for building energy efficiency applications is an important element in building energy policy and regulations. There are several methodologies available to conduct climatic zoning, providing significantly different results. Currently, there are no procedures to assess the validity of a proposed climatic zoning, hindering the decision to use one particular climatic zoning methodology instead of another. This paper introduces a quality index and a procedure to support the validation of climatic zoning. The procedure is based on building performance simulation results concerning the building stock that is targeted in the climatic zoning policy or program. Simulation results are used to calculate a new index, the Mean Percentage of Misclassified Areas (MPMA), which assesses the quality of the zoning under analysis. The capabilities of this procedure were demonstrated by the evaluation of four alternatives for the climatic zoning of Nicaragua, obtained using different methodologies and previously reported in the literature. The building stock used in this case study is composed of a few archetypes based on typical naturally ventilated dwellings in this country. Simulations were conducted using the program EnergyPlus for a total of 328 locations in Nicaragua. Degree-hours of discomfort based on the adaptive model of ASHRAE Standard 55 were used as a performance indicator. Results indicate that zoning obtained using cluster analysis and cooling degree-days may misclassify 1 out of 5 areas in Nicaragua (MPMA around 18–20{\%}). This study concludes that the validation procedure and proposed index are useful for highlighting qualities and deficiencies of existing climatic zoning methods, particularly when these methods are used in less conventional applications, such as for policy making targeting naturally ventilated dwellings in tropical climates. The application of this procedure in more than 50 countries which adopt climatic zoning is foreseen as the next step in his area, substantially affecting the prescription of building materials and components worldwide.},

A new methodology for the analysis of the parameters having the most effect on space cooling energy performance of a building is presented. The proposed methodology involves analysing the different contributions to the internal air convective heat balance and their interrelations with different boundary conditions. It is applied, by means of a multi-step dynamic numerical simulation, to a parametric analysis of two case studies, a residential and an office building. The contribution of the energy transmission through the building envelope to the building energy performance for cooling is compared with the contribution of the energy not transmitted through the envelope. The influence of the single parameters related to the envelope, and in particular the effect of the thermal insulation level, are investigated through the application of a sensitivity analysis. The methodology could be used in different applications: in the energy design of new buildings or in an energy audit of existing buildings, because of its potentiality to identify critical situations and to quantify the effects of improving solutions. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Building energy models provide valuable insight into energy use in commercial and residential buildings based on architecture, materials and thermal loads. They are used in the design of new buildings and retrofitting to increase the efficiency of older buildings. The accuracy of these models is crucial to reducing energy use in the US and building a sustainable energy future. In addition to the architecture and thermal loads, building energy models also must account for the effects of the building's occupants on energy use. Traditionally simple schedule based methods have been used to account for the effects of occupants. However, newer research has shown that these methods often result in large differences between the modeled and actual energy use of buildings. In this paper we discuss building energy models and their accuracy in predicting energy use. In particular we focus on the different types of validation methods which have been used to investigate the accuracy of building energy models and how they account for (or do not) the effects of occupants. We also review newer work on stochastic methods for estimating the effects of occupants on energy use and discuss the improvements necessary to increase the accuracy of building energy models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The research highlights the barriers that prevent this early integration and finally proposes the development of a methodology tailored around the optimization of energy efficiency during early-stage design. In general, the research aims to identify (a) the accuracy obtainable through progressive simplifications of the building model, (b) the most significant building parameters with respect to the model result accuracy and (c) the maximum number of simplifications able to ensure the respect of time requirements dictated by early-stage building design and to maintain an acceptable level of correctness. Here, as detailed example of simplification process, a case study of a large multi-storey office building is modelled starting with a previous detailed simulation performed through EnergyPlus and Openstudio software. The detailed model is then analyzed and progressively simplified. At each progressive simplification step, a comparison with the detailed results is given in terms of building energy needs and power curves of the system. The analysis is performed based on three different system hypotheses: a single-zone system and a variable air volume system with and without humidity control. The quantitative differences between detailed and simplified model are analyzed to determine the quality of the results of the simplified model. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Input parameters are selected from different passive design strategies including the building layout, envelop thermophysics, building geometry and infiltration {\&} air-tightness, while output indices are corresponding indoor environmental indices of the daylight, natural ventilation and thermal comfort to fulfil current green building requirements. The variation of sampling size, application of response transformation and bootstrap method, as well as different statistical regression models are tested and validated through separate modelling datasets. A sampling size of 100 per regression coefficient is determined from the variation of sensitivity coefficients, coefficients of determination and prediction uncertainties. The rank transformation of responses can calibrate sensitivity coefficients of a non-linear model, by considering their variation obtained from sufficient bootstrapping replications. Furthermore, the acquired meta-model with MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines) is proved to have better model fitting and predicting performances. This research can accurately identify important architectural design factors and make robust building performance predictions associated with the green building assessment.

Therefore, this study proposes a scientific approach to quantifying the energy savings potential due to improved operations of any stock of commercial buildings. The proposed framework combines energy modeling techniques, studies on human actions in buildings, and surveying and sampling methods. The contributions of this study to energy policy are significant as they reinforce the role of human actions in energy conservation, and support efforts to integrate operation-focused solutions in energy conservation policy frameworks. The framework's capabilities are illustrated in a case study performed on the stock of office buildings in the United States (US).

abstract = {Building performance simulation (BPS) has the potential to provide relevant design information by indicating directions for design solutions. A major challenge in simulation tools is how to deal with difficulties through large variety of parameters and complexity of factors such as non-linearity, discreteness, and uncertainty. The purpose of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis can be described as identifying uncertainties in input and output of a system or simulation tool [1-3]. In practice uncertainty and sensitivity analysis have many additional benefits including: (1) With the help of parameter screening it enables the simplification of a model [4]. (2) It allows the analysis of the robustness of a model [5]. (3) It makes aware of unexpected sensitivities that may lead to errors and/or wrong specifications (quality assurance) [6-10]. (4) By changing the input of the parameters and showing the effect on the outcome of a model, it provides a "what-if analysis" (decision support). [11]. In this paper a case study is performed based on an office building with respect to various building performance parameters. Uncertainty analysis (UA) is carried out and implications for the results considering energy consumption and thermal comfort are demonstrated and elaborated. The added value and usefulness of the integration of UA in BPS is shown. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis is a fundamental approach to identify the most significant and sensitive parameters, helping us to understand complex hydrological models, particularly for time-consuming distributed flood forecasting models based on complicated theory with numerous parameters. Based on Sobol' method, this study compared the sensitivity and interactions of distributed flood forecasting model parameters with and without accounting for correlation. Four objective functions: (1) Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (ENS); (2) water balance coefficient (WB); (3) peak discharge efficiency (EP); and (4) time to peak efficiency (ETP) were implemented to the Liuxihe model with hourly rainfall-runoff data collected in the Nanhua Creek catchment, Pearl River, China. Contrastive results for the sensitivity and interaction analysis were also illustrated among small, medium, and large flood magnitudes. Results demonstrated that the choice of objective functions had no effect on the sensitivity classification, while it had great influence on the sensitivity ranking for both uncorrelated and correlated cases. The Liuxihe model behaved and responded uniquely to various flood conditions. The results also indicated that the pairwise parameters interactions revealed a non-ignorable contribution to the model output variance. Parameters with high first or total order sensitivity indices presented a corresponding high second order sensitivity indices and correlation coefficients with other parameters. Without considering parameter correlations, the variance contributions of highly sensitive parameters might be underestimated and those of normally sensitive parameters might be overestimated. This research laid a basic foundation to improve the understanding of complex model behavior.},

A radial design is the one whereby starting from a random point in the hyperspace of the input factors one step in turn is taken for each factor. The procedure is iterated a number of times with a different starting random point as to collect a sample of elementary shifts for each factor. The total sensitivity index is a powerful sensitivity measure which can be estimated based on such a sample. Given the similarity between the total sensitivity index and a screening test known as method of the elementary effects (or method of Morris), we test the radial design on this method. Both methods are best practices: the total sensitivity index in the class of the quantitative measures and the elementary effects in that of the screening methods. We find that the radial design is indeed superior even for the computation of the elementary effects method. This opens the door to a sensitivity analysis strategy whereby the analyst can start with a small number of points (screening-wise) and then - depending on the results - possibly increase the numeral of points up to compute a fully quantitative measure. Also of interest to practitioners is that a radial design is nothing else than an iterated 'One factor At a Time' (OAT) approach. OAT is a radial design of size one. While OAT is not a good practice, modelers in all domains keep using it for sensitivity analysis for reasons discussed elsewhere (Saltelli and Annoni, 2010) [23]. With the present approach modelers are offered a straightforward and economic upgrade of their OAT which maintain OAT's appeal of having just one factor moved at each step. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Climate change concerns and certain ongoing utility Deamnd Side Management (DSM) Programs are influencing, and to some extent, revolutionising building design methods, while historically orth American low energy prices have limited the public demand for energy-efficient buildings, there is now a tendency toward mesuring building perfomrance in terms of both {\$}/m2 ({\$}/ft2) and kg eCO2/m2 emitted into the atmosphere. the drive towards efficiency and preservation of the environment continues to foster research activities to eplore the limiets of energy efficiency which embrace a "back-to-basics" deisgn philosophy. this research was started in the 1980a by deisgners, utilities and government agencies to demonstrate the concept of whole building design to minimise building energy use and capital costs.  this paper discusses the concept of whole building design and provides a step-by-step appraoch. the objective is minimisation of loads, optimised selection of mechnaical equipment addressing both proper sizing and equipment efficiency, commissioning and operation. the appraoch hinges on the integration od th earchitectural and mechanical designs early in the design process.  the intrinsic synergies between energy end-uses that are present when integrating the design of all end-uses is also discussed. this is illustrated by showing that oppportunities to downsize air handling equipment and chillers can be derived from energy effiicent lighting deisgns. the discussion of such opportunities includes the offsetting effects on incremental dsign and equipment costs that result with equipment deownsizing. the ability to achiever superior efficiency with only marginal cost increases is one of themost appealing features of IDA.  the effect on energy use and reduction on equipment size is quantified through hourly simulations using DOE 2.1E. the simulation outputs are based on two hypothetical high rise office building built in San Franisco and Ottawa.},

abstract = {Building energy predictions are playing an important role in steering the design towards the required sustainability regulations. Time-consuming nature of detailed Building Energy Modelling (BEM) has introduced simplified BEM and metamodels within the design process. The paper further elaborates the limitations of this method and proposes a component-based Machine Learning Modelling (MLM) approach which could potentially overcome the current limitations. The paper proposes a methodology for developing component-based MLM that generalise well. Generalisation, in this paper, refers to the reusability of an MLM developed with data from a specific situation in similar circumstances. As a first step in ongoing research on component-based MLM, a model is developed with data from a simple box building with weather data of Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris and two occupancy profiles. It is shown that the MLM is able to predict the annual energy for (1) same box building under different weather conditions not included in the training data (2) different dimensions of the box building for one case weather data and occupancy. The prediction error for annual heating demand is lower than 10{\%} for all evaluated cases while the prediction error for annual cooling demand ranges -3.4{\%} to 28.3{\%}. Good generalisation is observed for all heating energy predictions whereas only for a few cooling energy predictions. Possibilities for model improvement and next steps of the research project are described.},

The annual electricity use per unit gross floor area ranged from 233 to 368kWh/m2, with a mean of 292kWh/m2. The ranges of percentage consumption for the four major electricity end-users – namely heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC), lighting, electrical equipment, and lifts and escalators – were 40.1–50.7{\%}, 22.1–29{\%}, 16.6–32.9{\%} and 2.2–5.3{\%}, respectively. Ten key design variables were identified in the parametric and sensitivity analysis using building energy simulation technique. Analysis of the resulting influence coefficients suggested that indoor design condition (from 22 to 25.5°C), electric lighting (a modest 2W/m2 reduction in the current lighting code) and chiller COP (from air- to water-cooled) could offer great electricity savings potential, in the order of 14{\%}, 5.2{\%} and 11{\%}, respectively.},

abstract = {Thermal insulation is one of the most effective energy conservation measures for cooling and heating in buildings. Therefore, determining and selecting the optimum thickness of insulation is the main subject of many engineering investigations. In this study, the determination of optimum insulation thickness on external walls of buildings is comparatively analyzed based on annual heating and cooling loads. The transmission loads, calculated by using measured long-term meteorological data for selected cities, are fed into an economic model (P1-P2 method) in order to determine the optimum insulation thickness. The degree-hours method that is the simplest and most intuitive way of estimating the annual energy consumption of a building is used in this study. The results show that the use of insulation in building walls with respect to cooling degree-hours is more significant for energy savings compared to heating degree-hours in Turkey's warmest zone. The optimum insulation thickness varies between 3.2 and 3.8 cm; the energy savings varies between 8.47 and 12.19 {\$}/m2; and the payback period varies between 3.39 and 3.81 years depending on the cooling degree-hours. On the other hand, for heating load, insulation thickness varies between 1.6 and 2.7 cm, energy savings varies between 2.2 and 6.6 {\$}/m2, and payback periods vary between 4.15 and 5.47 years. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis is a fundamental approach to identify the most significant and sensitive parameters, helping us to understand complex hydrological models, particularly for time-consuming distributed flood forecasting models based on complicated theory with numerous parameters. Based on Sobol' method, this study compared the sensitivity and interactions of distributed flood forecasting model parameters with and without accounting for correlation. Four objective functions: (1) Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (ENS); (2) water balance coefficient (WB); (3) peak discharge efficiency (EP); and (4) time to peak efficiency (ETP) were implemented to the Liuxihe model with hourly rainfall-runoff data collected in the Nanhua Creek catchment, Pearl River, China. Contrastive results for the sensitivity and interaction analysis were also illustrated among small, medium, and large flood magnitudes. Results demonstrated that the choice of objective functions had no effect on the sensitivity classification, while it had great influence on the sensitivity ranking for both uncorrelated and correlated cases. The Liuxihe model behaved and responded uniquely to various flood conditions. The results also indicated that the pairwise parameters interactions revealed a non-ignorable contribution to the model output variance. Parameters with high first or total order sensitivity indices presented a corresponding high second order sensitivity indices and correlation coefficients with other parameters. Without considering parameter correlations, the variance contributions of highly sensitive parameters might be underestimated and those of normally sensitive parameters might be overestimated. This research laid a basic foundation to improve the understanding of complex model behavior.},

Alternate activation functions having similar properties are also discussed. A fourlayer neural network of the type proposed can map any input pattern to any number of classifications. The decision boundaries can be modified in real-time using new data as they become available, and can be implemented using artificial hardware "neurons" that operate entirely in parallel. Provision is also made for estimating the probability and reliability of a classification as well as making the decision. The technique offers a tremendous speed advantage for problems in which the incremental adaptation time of back propagation is a significant fraction of the total computation time. For one application, the PNN paradigm was 200,000 times faster than back-propagation. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

They find that, on average, LEED buildings use 18-39{\%} less energy per floor area than their conventional counterparts, consistent with and adding clarity to conclusions originally reached by NBI. These conclusions, however, hang on a particular definition of the mean energy intensity of a collection of buildings that is not related to the total energy used by those buildings. Furthermore, site energy considered by Newsham et al. and NBI, unlike source energy used for the EPA's building Energy Star rating, does not account for the energy consumed off-site in generating and delivering electric energy to the building, whose inclusion is crucial for understanding greenhouse gas emission associated with building operation. Here I demonstrate that both the site energy and source energy used by the set of 35 LEED office buildings and Newsham et al.'s matching CBECS office buildings are statistically equivalent. Hence Newsham et al. offer no evidence that LEED-certification has collectively lowered either site or source energy for office buildings. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Given climate change predictions of a warmer world, there is growing concern that insulation-led improvements in building fabric aimed at reducing carbon emissions will exacerbate overheating. If true, this would seriously affect building regulations all over the world which have moved towards increased insulation regimes. Despite extensive research, the literature has failed to resolve the controversy of insulation performance, primarily due to varied scope and limited comparability of results. We approach this problem through carefully constructed pairwise comparisons designed to isolate the effect of insulation on overheating. We encompass the complete range of relevant variables: latitude, climate, insulation, thermal mass, glazing ratio, shading, occupancy, infiltration, ventilation, orientation, and thermal comfort models — creating 576,000 building variants. Data mining techniques are implemented in a novel framework to analyse this large dataset. To provide confidence, the modelling was validated against data collected from well-insulated dwellings. Our results demonstrate that all parameters have a significant impact on overheating risk. Although insulation is seen to both decrease and increase overheating, depending on the influence of other parameters, parameter ranking shows that insulation only accounts for up to 5{\%} of overall overheating response. Indeed, in cases that are not already overheating through poor design, there is a strong overall tendency for increased insulation to reduce overheating. These results suggest that, in cases with acceptable overheating levels (below 3.7{\%}), the use of improved insulation levels as part of a national climate change mitigation policy is not only sensible, but also helps deliver better indoor thermal environments.},

This paper investigates the ability of the current codes to achieve such a benchmark and evaluates their impact on building energy consumption. The results of a simulation study are employed to investigate the impact of the Bahraini codes on the energy and environmental performance of buildings. The study focuses on air-conditioned commercial buildings and concludes that envelope codes, at best, are likely to reduce the energy use of the commercial sector by 25{\%} if the building envelope is well-insulated and efficient glazing is used. Bahraini net CO2 emissions could drop to around 7.1{\%}.

Secondly, in response to the lack of an MDO best practice EEPFD is investigated and evaluated through two experiments. The first experiment demonstrates the ability to utilize EEPFD provided energy performance as feedback to pursue multiple architectural designs with competing objectives and tradeoffs. The second experiment identifies performance boundaries as a best practice for MDO applications to the early stage architectural design processes. The research synthesizes the results into the basis for measuring these performance boundaries as a best practice in the context where architects must gauge multiple design concepts with varying complexity coupled with performance objectives through EEPFD, thereby enhancing the influence of energy performance feedback on the early stage design process.

Benchmarking models are mostly constructed in a simple benchmark table (percentile table) of energy use, which is normalized with floor area and temperature. This paper describes a benchmarking process for energy efficiency by means of multiple regression analysis, where the relationship between energy-use intensities (EUIs) and the explanatory factors (e.g., operating hours) is developed. Using the resulting regression model, these EUIs are then normalized by removing the effect of deviance in the significant explanatory factors. The empirical cumulative distribution of the normalized EUI gives a benchmark table (or percentile table of EUI) for benchmarking an observed EUI. The advantage of this approach is that the benchmark table represents a normalized distribution of EUI, taking into account all the significant explanatory factors that affect energy consumption. An application to supermarkets is presented to illustrate the development and the use of the benchmarking method. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Building form does influence energy consumption. Designing low-energy architecture to minimize energy consumption requires thoughtful articulation of the shape and form of a building. The Architect's decision-making for more energy efficient building form is often based on rules of thumb. Historically, the rule of thumb regarding passive solar building design suggests that form and orientation matter to overall energy performance. The question of how much impact does form have varies between project to project, due to climate, location, and building size. However, evaluation of energy performance specifically relating to building form is difficult to quantify because of the large solution space, but nonetheless important to understand.The paper presents a methodology to evaluate building form to in order to compare energy consumption of geometric variations and material considerations through two types of sensitivity analyses. First, a review of related studies discussing energy and form are discussed, second the geometric methodology for vertical and horizontal proportion is described, and finally the linear screening local sensitivity index and a Morris global sensitivity results are reviewed. Findings compare geometric and material sensitivity, as well as the two different types of sensitivity analyses. Results indicate that both the vertical and horizontal geometric proportion is equally as sensitive as certain material aspects related to building energy use. Outcomes provide building designers clarity on the formal variations in the early design phase informing design decision-making.},

By reviewing the academic literature on SA, we here present a bibliometric analysis of the trends of different SA practices in last decade. The review has been conducted both on some top ranking journals (Nature and Science) and through an extended analysis in the Elsevier's Scopus database of scientific publications. After correcting for the global growth in publications, the amount of papers performing a generic SA has notably increased over the last decade. Even if OAT is still the most largely used technique in SA, there is a clear increase in the use of GSA with preference respectively for regression and variance-based techniques. Even after adjusting for the growth of publications in the sole modelling field, to which SA and GSA normally apply, the trend is confirmed. Data about regions of origin and discipline are also briefly discussed. The results above are confirmed when zooming on the sole articles published in chemical modelling, a field historically proficient in the use of SA methods.},

abstract = {Retrofit actions applied to the existent building stock aim at increasing the energy performance, considering the optimal trade-off between energy savings and costs, according to the Directive 2010/31/EU. To select effective refurbishment measures and to quantify the energy saving potentials of the existent building stock, the analysis should be performed on "reference buildings".This article presents a methodology for the identification of reference buildings, according to the IEE-TABULA project (2009-12) aimed at creating a harmonised structure for "European Building Typologies". Among the possible applications of the building typology, this work focuses on the potentialities of energy savings and CO2 emission reductions for the European residential building stock. In particular, the Italian approach to model the energy balance of a subset of the national building stock is described; the results show the enormous potentialities of energy savings even with basic energy retrofit actions. Cost analyses were not in the scope of the project, but the results of this study are the basis for further investigations aimed at assessing the cost effectiveness of sets of measures. In this regard, the TABULA building-types are being applied by the Italian government for calculating cost-optimal levels of energy performance, complying with the Directive 2010/31/EU objectives. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis (SA) is usually carried out along with energy simulations to understand buildings performance and reduce their consumptions. The quality of their results mainly depends on thermal models and input data. Having accurate data about properties and operation conditions of buildings is difficult. In consequence, simulation inputs are affected by uncertainties that may have significant effects on outputs and are important to be considered. Law-driven detailed models are widely used. They ensure reliability and versatility but require a large number of input parameters. The paper addresses the difficulties of getting information from SA using detailed models with existing techniques and proposes a methodology which solves current problems. The methodology consists of using a detailed model of the building, defining and propagating uncertainties of input parameters, calculating macroparameters that characterize the building and getting sensitivity indices. The procedure is applied to the study case of a dwelling in which weather and occupancy are found out to be the strongest parameters on its annual consumption. It should be highlighted that, keeping the structure of inputs with uncertainties required by complex models that defines buildings in detail, the method eases building performance understanding. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The main objective of this paper is to present and to validate a computational modeling approach to accurately predict the mean wind pressure coefficient on the surfaces of flat-, gable- and hip-roofed rectangular buildings. This approach makes use of artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the surface-average pressure coefficient for each wall and roof according to the building geometry and the wind angle. Three separate ANN models were developed, one for each roof type, and trained using an experimental database. Applied to a wide variety of buildings, the current ANN models were proved to be considerably more accurate than the commonly used parametric equations for the estimation of pressure coefficients. The proposed ANN-based methodology is as general and versatile as to be easily expanded to buildings with different shapes as well as to be coupled to building performance simulation and airflow network programs.},

abstract = {Understanding the energy demand of cities is a challenge especially in countries such as Brazil where the lack of building energy consumption benchmarks makes it hard to decide upon interventions in the building stock, as neither the existing nor the attainable energy performance are known. Aiming to overcome these difficulties this study develops a framework to estimate the Energy Use Intensity (EUI) baseline of an existing building stock category based on the investigation of land use regulations, a land tax database and field surveys. These offer a starting point to estimate current energy consumption and promising interventions without having to study specific buildings in depth. A case study of the high-rise commercial building stock took place in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Three representative typologies were identified. For each of these, archetype energy models were created in order to assess EUI. The analysis of the EUI baselines highlights differences between archetypes, explaining the impact of technical choices on the overall electricity consumption and indicating a growing tendency of energy consumption for forthcoming buildings. The archetype analysis also provides knowledge to identify the most promising energy savings potential and thus to support further energy policies in the city.},

The climatic data of cities is not always available, so the CTE method has proposed some solutions, but they are not always precise enough. In this paper, we propose an alternative classification of climatic zones as a result of applying a new method based on approximation and interpolation functions, with a maximum error of 5.773e - 15 in summer and 6.661e - 16 in winter. This new method has been applied and tested in Andalusia in Southern Spain, a region with 772 municipalities. According to the climatic data available, the new proposed method has resulted in more precise climatic zones than the two versions of the CTE (2009 version and the 2013 update). The results are closer to reality, and the method is exportable to any region.},

abstract = {Energy certification schemes for buildings emerged in the early 1990s as an essential method for improving energy efficiency, minimising energy consumption and enabling greater transparency with regards to the use of energy in buildings. However, from the beginning their definition and implementation process were diffuse and, occasionally, have confused building sector stakeholders. A multiplicity of terms and concepts such as energy performance, energy efficiency, energy ratings, benchmarking, labelling, etc., have emerged with sometimes overlapping meanings. This has frequently led to misleading interpretations by regulatory bodies, energy agencies and final consumers. This paper analyses the origin and the historic development of energy certification schemes in buildings along with the definition and scope of a building energy certificate and critical aspects of its implementation. Concepts such as benchmarking tools, energy ratings and energy labelling are clarified within the wider topic of certification schemes. Finally, a seven steps process is proposed as a guide for implementing building energy certification. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {After the first federal law on energy efficiency was published in 2001, the Brazilian government promoted several actions on energy efficiency, including the Federal Regulation for Voluntary Labeling of Energy Efficiency Levels in Commercial, Public and Service Buildings. Divided into three parts, lighting system, HVAC and building envelope, it is expected to become mandatory in 2013. This paper describes the criteria adopted to evaluate the envelope efficiency level, focusing on the development of a regression equation which provides an electricity consumption indicator. The envelope label is divided into five efficiency levels, from A (more efficient) to E (less efficient), identified according to the electricity consumption indicator. The linear regression equation considers variables such as window to wall ratio (WWR), SHGC, solar protection angles, building volume indicators and the roof Uvalue. The Uvalue of the walls was excluded from the equation due to its non-linearity. Its relation with electricity consumption depends on internal gains, exterior temperatures, building size and thermal capacity of the walls and could not be described by a linear regression equation. Some limitations were identified and shape factor limits were provided. The envelope efficiency label is obtained by the comparison of the electricity consumption indicator of the proposed building with the electricity consumption indicators of two other building envelopes presented. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, as a consequence of a fragmented building industry building performance simulations (BPSs) in the early design stage are closely related to who is creating and operating the BPS models. This paper critically reviews the different ways designers and analysts use BPS in the early design stage. One of the key findings is that most tools and methods used in the early design stages are insufficient to provide valid feedback while in the same time being flexible enough to accommodate a rapid changing design process. The main concern points to the way geometrical models and analytical models are combined and how this affects the way the buildings are designed and perform. This paper concludes that integrated dynamic models may combine a design tool, a visual programming language and a BPS to provide better support for the designer during the early stages of design as opposed to alternatives such as the current implementation of IFC or gbXML or the unaccompanied use of simulation packages.},

Multi-disciplinary collaboration is considered necessary for solving complex designs, and belief in its merits is unequivocal in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) literature. However, this paper argues that collaboration is a challenging endeavour that entails creating a unified platform for professionals to converge. Challenges are compounded when the collaboration is for building performance assessments, as architects' and Building Performance Simulation (BPS) consultants' worldviews are divergent. This paper presents part of a mixed-methods study investigating collaborative relationships between architects and BPS consultants. Questionnaires are designed to re-test non-technical barriers in collaboration, described during preceding interviews. Six salient factors representing barriers impeding fruitful collaborations are extracted, and inter-relationships are explored using inferential statistics. Barriers include perceptions about architects' attitudes toward BPS, using BPS for compliance, trust and communication between architects and consultants. Finally, this research illustrates how recourse to methodologies from outside the traditional BPS realm may open new research avenues in this field.},

We scrutinise three distinctive sensitivity analysis methods: (a) the computationally efficient Morris method for parameter screening, (b) linear regression analysis (medium computational costs) and (c) Sobol method (high computational costs). It is revealed that the results from Morris method taking the commonly used measure for parameter influence can be unstable, while using the median value yields robust results for evaluations with small sample sizes. For the dominant parameters the results from all three sensitivity analysis methods are in very good agreement. Regarding the evaluation of parameter ranking or the differentiation of influential and negligible parameters, the computationally costly quantitative methods provide the same information for the model in this study as the computational efficient Morris method using the median value. Exploring different methods to investigate higher-order effects and parameter interactions, reveals that correlation of elementary effects and parameter values in Morris method can also provide basic information about parameter interactions.},

A total of 1,944 parametric simulation runs were carried out for three different cities and climate zones in Brazil (Curitiba, Brasilia and Salvador), considering variation of window-to-wall ratio, SHGC of the glazing system, insulation thickness in exterior walls, type of walls, and internal load densities. The results have confirmed that the building envelope has more influence on cooling energy consumption for building models with low interior load densities. Thermal insulation of exterior walls has negative impact for Brazilian cold climate, increasing the energy consumption for cooling as avoid the internal heat dissipation to the exterior environment. But in hot climate the energy consumption for cooling can be decreased with thermal insulation of exterior walls. In this case, the energy savings for cooling achieved up to 3.3{\%}. Thermal insulation of exterior walls revealed to be a good solution to reduce peak cooling loads for the three climates under analysis, with 7.8{\%} of maximum cooling capacity saving for the hottest city.},

abstract = {Degree days (DD) represent a versatile climatic indicator which is commonly used in the analysis of building energy performance, as e.g. (i) to perform energetic assessment of existent and new buildings, (ii) to analyze the territory energy consumption, (iii) to develop scenario analyses in terms of energy consumption forecasting, and so on. Different methods can be used for determining the DD values, depending on the available climatic data of each location. In the present paper, the simplified methods based on reduced climatic data set have been compared assuming the mean daily degree-hours method (MDDH) as reference. Hourly temperature profiles recorded by the meteorological station located at the University of Genoa have been used for these analyses. In the second part of the present work, the ASHRAE method has been selected to calculate heating (HDD) and cooling (CDD) degree days for several Italian cities. In particular, daily meteorological data of several Italian cities (covering the whole climatic conditions which occur in Italy) have been used to calculate heating and cooling degree days in the period 1978-2013, in order to analyze their trends in the last years. Finally, the historical profiles of Rome and Milan have been treated as time-series and analyzed in the frequency domain, performing a decomposition of the original data set into different characterizing components. This simplified approach permits to deeply analyze the historical profile of DD and represents a simple starting point method for future analyses with forecasting perspectives.},

Here, we propose a method for calculating power and sample size for studies using current status data. This method is based on a Weibull survival model for a two-group comparison. The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of these proposed power calculations.},

Thus, the objective of this paper is to analyse how the computer models can influence the results of heating and cooling energy consumption in a building. Three types of analyses were performed: (1) deterministic, (2) parameter variation and (3) parameter uncertainty. Fifteen computer models were created to represent the real building. Such models differ in relation to external geometry, grouping of internal zones and internal thermal mass. The simulations were performed using the EnergyPlus programme, for three climates in Brazil. The model represents the real building properly when the simulation run time was reduced, and the results were close to the base case. For the deterministic analysis, the modelling uncertainties ranged from -16.0{\%} to 8.3{\%} for energy consumption in Florian??polis climate. As for the cooling energy consumption, the uncertainty was lower, i.e., up to 7.4{\%}. These uncertainties are relatively high, and should be accounted for in calibration or even in computer simulations. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Climatic zoning is an essential element of most building energy efficiency programs, however there is no widely accepted scientific technique for its delineation. This paper reports an investigation on this issue, which comprised the review of climatic zoning methodologies for building energy efficiency programs adopted by 54 countries. The paper identified that the nature and magnitude of climatic variations are not the main elements in the definition of the number of climatic zones in a country. The number of climatic zones seems to be mainly driven by the expected simplicity of the final climatic zoning, respecting in most cases a maximum of 8 zones independent of the country size and climatic variations. A total of 19 different variables, techniques and parameters used in climatic zoning were identified, the most frequent being temperature, degree days, altitude, administrative divisions and relative humidity. However, around 80{\%} of the countries analysed in this study used only up to three variables/techniques/parameters to define their climatic zoning. This simplicity comes at the cost of ignoring several aspects of climate and building energy performance. From the techniques identified in this review, only the combination of building performance simulation and cluster analysis seems to provide robust tools to tackle the complex relations between climate and building energy performance. Combined, these tools may provide the means to explore scenarios and support evidence-based decision making in energy policy. The lack of consensus in several aspects of climate zoning indicates the need for further research in this area.},

However, a sound argumentation that vouches for the reliability, validity and necessary complexity of the chosen SA method for the specific purpose of the BEM-based analysis, is rare. This paper reports on an investigation of how two different levels of a-priori information about input parameters, applied to three different SA methods (Local, Morris and Sobol), influenced the identification and ranking of the input parameters that the annual energy need output of a quasi-steady-state BEM using monthly time steps, and a simple dynamic BEM using hourly time steps, is most sensitive to. It was found that the three SA methods, to a great extent, were able to identify the same cluster of most sensitive input parameters, independent of the level of a-priori input parameter information and BEM. However, the ranking of most sensitive input parameters varied with the applied SA method, BEM, and level of a-priori input parameter information. From a practical point of view, the choice of appropriate SA method is concluded to depend on the purpose of the SA analysis.},

It is a positional paper written from a building designer's viewpoint that basically agrees with the proposition that design is no longer dominated by physical structure thinking but by performance and system based concerns. However, the authors still recognise the need to find appropriate criteria, which are directly related to design actions, to evaluate performance and therefore effectively relate design decisions to simulation results. The proposed framework operates within an integrated dynamic system methodology in which outputs, performance goals, optimisation and controls are dealt with at the level of the building envelope response instead of the overall building response. It is believed that the best way to set up a conversation between designers and simulationists is not to swing between the two points of view but to establish a unified framework for discussion disconnected from any specific tool or performance target.},

abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimiza-tion. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a compar-ison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural net-works and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising con-figuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent " High Throughput " methods achieve surprising success—they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural base-line against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

The combination of all possible variations of the properties and their values resulted in more than 2.5 quadrillion cases. One million cases sampled by Latin Hypercube method were considered. Several statistical modelling techniques were tested to generate the surrogate model: multiple linear regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines, support vector machines, the Gaussian process, random forests and artificial neural networks. The surrogate model was applied into a medium office to observe the difference between building energy simulation results. The results showed that the artificial neural network method presented the best performance, with a NRMSE below 1{\%}.

Time-consuming nature of detailed Building Energy Modelling (BEM) has introduced simplified BEM and metamodels within the design process. The paper further elaborates the limitations of this method and proposes a component-based Machine Learning Modelling (MLM) approach which could potentially overcome the current limitations. The paper proposes a methodology for developing component-based MLM that generalise well. Generalisation, in this paper, refers to the reusability of an MLM developed with data from a specific situation in similar circumstances. As a first step in ongoing research on component-based MLM, a model is developed with data from a simple box building with weather data of Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris and two occupancy profiles. It is shown that the MLM is able to predict the annual energy for (1) same box building under different weather conditions not included in the training data (2) different dimensions of the box building for one case weather data and occupancy. The prediction error for annual heating demand is lower than 10{\%} for all evaluated cases while the prediction error for annual cooling demand ranges -3.4{\%} to 28.3{\%}. Good generalisation is observed for all heating energy predictions whereas only for a few cooling energy predictions.

abstract = {Uncertainty analysis in building energy assessment has become an active research field because a number of factors influencing energy use in buildings are inherently uncertain. This paper provides a systematic review on the latest research progress of uncertainty analysis in building energy assessment from four perspectives: uncertainty data sources, forward and inverse methods, application of uncertainty analysis, and available software. First, this paper describes the data sources of uncertainty in building performance analysis to provide a firm foundation for specifying variations of uncertainty factors affecting building energy. The next two sections focus on the forward and inverse methods. Forward uncertainty analysis propagates input uncertainty through building energy models to obtain variations of energy use, whereas inverse uncertainty analysis infers unknown input factors through building energy models based on energy data and prior information. For forward analysis, three types of approaches (Monte Carlo, non-sampling, and non-probabilistic) are discussed to provide sufficient choices of uncertainty methods depending on the purpose and specific application of a building project. For inverse analysis, recent research has concentrated more on Bayesian computation because Bayesian inverse methods can make full use of prior information on unknown variables. Fourth, several applications of uncertainty analysis in building energy assessment are discussed, including building stock analysis, HVAC system sizing, variations of sensitivity indicators, and optimization under uncertainty. Moreover, the software for uncertainty analysis is described to provide flexible computational environments for implementing uncertainty methods described in this review. This paper concludes with the trends and recommendations for further research to provide more convenient and robust uncertainty analysis of building energy. Uncertainty analysis has been ready to become the mainstream approach in building energy assessment although a number of issues still need to be addressed.},

abstract = {Buildings account for nearly 38{\%} of the total energy use in the U.S., and 46{\%} of this use is associated with commercial buildings. More than 40{\%} of the energy in commercial buildings is consumed by HVAC systems, which provide heating, cooling and ventilation to individual zones to maintain comfortable and healthy indoor environments. A more refined control strategy based on actual occupancy might improve HVAC system related energy efficiency. Accurate occupancy profiles are important to determine actual energy demands and corresponding control schedules. This paper focuses on energy efficiency in office buildings with centrally controlled VAV systems by setting zone-level HVAC start/stop schedules using personalized occupancy profiles, which represent occupants' long-term presence patterns. Evaluation of the method was performed using a simulation model, calibrated by the actual energy use data of an office test bed building. Up to 9{\%} of the energy was saved when personalized occupancy profile based HVAC schedules were used. However, if occupants of a zone have different occupancy patterns, the aggregated patterns may hinder any potential efficiency that might be realized from zone-level HVAC start/stop schedules. This paper also presents an approach for reassigning rooms to unify the start/stop times at the zone level by placing occupants with similar profiles in the same mechanical zones. When room reassignment was implemented and coupled with profile based control schedule, HVAC energy use was reduced by another 8{\%}. The proposed methods could provide reliable personalized HVAC control for small-size office buildings without advanced building automation systems, nevertheless, they could also be extended to buildings with packaged HVAC systems and individual air-conditioning systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Building performance simulations (BPS) are used to test different designs and systems with the intention of reducing building costs and energy demand while ensuring a comfortable indoor climate. Unfortunately, software for BPS is computationally intensive. This makes it impractical to run thousands of simulations for sensitivity analysis and optimization. Worse yet, millions of simulations may be necessary for a thorough exploration of the high-dimensional design space formed by the many design parameters. This computational issue may be overcome by the creation of fast metamodels. In this paper, we aim to find suitable metamodeling techniques for diverse outputs from BPS. We consider five indicators of building performance and eight test problems for the comparison six popular metamodeling techniques – linear regression with ordinary least squares (OLS), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), multivariate adaptive regression splines, Gaussian process regression (GPR), and neural network (NN). The methods are compared with respect to accuracy, efficiency, ease-of-use, robustness, and interpretability. To conduct a fair and in-depth comparison, a methodological approach is pursued using exhaustive grid searches for model selection assisted by sensitivity analysis. The comparison shows that GPR produces the most accurate metamodels, followed by NN and MARS. GPR is robust and easy to implement but becomes inefficient for large training sets compared to NN and MARS. A coefficient of determination, R2, larger than 0.9 have been obtained for the BPS outputs using between 128 and 1024 training points. In contrast, accurate metamodels with R2values larger than 0.99 can be achieved for all eight test problems using only 32–256 training points.},

This quantity can be for instance the variance of an output variable.

abstract = {Building performance assessment is complex, as it has to respond to multiple criteria. Objectives originating from the demands that are put on energy consumption, acoustical performance, thermal occupant comfort, indoor air quality and many other issues must all be reconciled. An assessment requires the use of predictive models that involve numerous design and physical parameters as their inputs. Since these input parameters, as well as the models that operate on them, are not precisely known, it is imprudent to assume deterministic values for them. A more realistic approach is to introduce ranges of uncertainty in the parameters themselves, or in their derivation, from underlying approximations. In so doing, it is recognized that the outcome of a performance assessment is influenced by many sources of uncertainty. As a consequence of this approach the design process is informed by assessment outcomes that produce probability distributions of a target measure instead of its deterministic value. In practice this may lead to a “well informed” analysis but not necessarily to a straightforward, cost effective and efficient design process. This paper discusses how design decision making can be based on uncertainty assessments. A case study is described focussing on a discrete decision that involves a choice between two HVAC system designs. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) including uncertainty information is used to arrive at a rational decision. In this approach, key performance indicators such as energy efficiency, thermal comfort and others are ranked according to their importance and preferences. This process enables a clear group consensus based choice of one of the two options. The research presents a viable means of collaboratively ranking complex design options based on stakeholder's preferences and considering the uncertainty involved in the designs. In so doing it provides important feedback to the design team.},

abstract = {Though sensitivity analysis has been widely applied in the context of building energy models (BEMs), there are few studies that investigate the performance of different sensitivity analysis methods in relation to dynamic, high-order, non-linear behaviour and the level of uncertainty in building energy models. We scrutinise three distinctive sensitivity analysis methods: (a) the computationally efficient Morris method for parameter screening, (b) linear regression analysis (medium computational costs) and (c) Sobol method (high computational costs). It is revealed that the results from Morris method taking the commonly used measure for parameter influence can be unstable, while using the median value yields robust results for evaluations with small sample sizes. For the dominant parameters the results from all three sensitivity analysis methods are in very good agreement. Regarding the evaluation of parameter ranking or the differentiation of influential and negligible parameters, the computationally costly quantitative methods provide the same information for the model in this study as the computational efficient Morris method using the median value. Exploring different methods to investigate higher-order effects and parameter interactions, reveals that correlation of elementary effects and parameter values in Morris method can also provide basic information about parameter interactions.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a high level of demand for sustainable design of buildings construction. The catalysts for such demand are rising energy costs and increasing environmental concerns. Therefore, it is important to evaluate building energy consumption, which is the key problem of building energy saving. There is a need for a reliable energy simulation model to predict buildings energy consumption. In addition, designers suffer from the limitations of energy simulation tools during the early design stage that addresses buildings envelope and orientation. This study proposes a strategy for visualized parametric energy analysis of buildings during the conceptual design phase. It presents an energy-oriented workflow that accommodates the Egyptian context. A residential building model is developed by coupling parametric analysis and building energy modeling tools as a means of developing an energy consumption database. The parallel coordinate plot is used to visualize the database to allow decision makers to flexibly evaluate energy performance. The advantages of this paper stem from: 1) providing a new strategy for visualizing the predicting building energy consumption data; 2) facilitating the process of decision making for energy design alternatives during early stages; 3) integrating parametric modeling and energy simulation engine in one platform to come over the problem of interoperability; 4) developing a generic model with variant energy simulation parameters; and 5) presenting an automated and simplified approach to enable modelers to simulate and analyze building energy performance with a more timely, accurate and efficient process.},

abstract = {Degree days (DD) represent a versatile climatic indicator which is commonly used in the analysis of building energy performance, as e.g. (i) to perform energetic assessment of existent and new buildings, (ii) to analyze the territory energy consumption, (iii) to develop scenario analyses in terms of energy consumption forecasting, and so on. Different methods can be used for determining the DD values, depending on the available climatic data of each location. In the present paper, the simplified methods based on reduced climatic data set have been compared assuming the mean daily degree-hours method (MDDH) as reference. Hourly temperature profiles recorded by the meteorological station located at the University of Genoa have been used for these analyses. In the second part of the present work, the ASHRAE method has been selected to calculate heating (HDD) and cooling (CDD) degree days for several Italian cities. In particular, daily meteorological data of several Italian cities (covering the whole climatic conditions which occur in Italy) have been used to calculate heating and cooling degree days in the period 1978-2013, in order to analyze their trends in the last years. Finally, the historical profiles of Rome and Milan have been treated as time-series and analyzed in the frequency domain, performing a decomposition of the original data set into different characterizing components. This simplified approach permits to deeply analyze the historical profile of DD and represents a simple starting point method for future analyses with forecasting perspectives.},

The publication of national energy benchmarks is a fundamental step for understanding energy consumption in commercial buildings and developing energy efficiency programmes. A voluntary data gathering initiative by the Brazilian Sustainable Construction Council (CBCS) is producing the data necessary to develop national benchmarks. A methodology for benchmark development is proposed, using both statistical data and energy audit data to benchmark end-use energy consumption, with the use of wet-bulb cooling degree hours for climate correction. Benchmarks and climate corrections are developed for the energy consumption of bank branches in Brazil. A simple linear regression analysis of data from 1890 bank branches in 57 different climates provides the energy consumption benchmark, while thermal simulation of building performance is used to validate the results and provide an end-use breakdown in the different climates studied.

abstract = {We present a new technique called “t-SNE” that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence theway in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza- tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

abstract = {Surrogate models are an important part of building energy labelling programs, but these models still present low accuracy, particularly in cooling-dominated climates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using an artificial neural network (ANN) to improve the accuracy of surrogate models for labelling purposes. An ANN was applied to model the building stock of a city in Brazil, based on the results of extensive simulations using the high-resolution building energy simulation program EnergyPlus. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were carried out to evaluate the behaviour of the ANN model, and the variations in the best and worst performance for several typologies were analysed in relation to variations in the input parameters and building characteristics. The results obtained indicate that an ANN can represent the interaction between input and output data for a vast and diverse building stock. Sensitivity analysis showed that no single input parameter can be identified as the main factor responsible for the building energy performance. The uncertainty associated with several parameters plays a major role in assessing building energy performance, together with the facade area and the shell-to-floor ratio. The results of this study may have a profound impact as ANNs could be applied in the future to define regulations in many countries, with positive effects on optimizing the energy consumption.},

abstract = {Statistical energy modelling {\&} analysis of building stock is becoming mainstream in the context of city or district scale analysis of energy saving measures. A common aspect in such analyses is that there is generally a set of key explanatory variables - or the main inputs - that are statistically related to a quantity of interest (end-use energy or CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}). In the context of energy use in buildings, it is not uncommon that the explanatory variables may be correlated. However, there has been little discussion about the correlated variables in building stock research. This paper uses a set of campus buildings as a demonstrative case study to investigate the application of variable importance and meta-model construction in the case of correlated inputs when quantifying energy demand of a building stock. The variable importance analysis can identify key factors that explain energy consumption of a building stock. To this end, it is necessary to apply methods suitable for correlated inputs because the observational data (inputs) of buildings are usually correlated. For constructing statistical energy meta-models, two types of regression models are used: linear and non-parametric models. The results indicate that the linear models perform well compared to the complicated non-parametric models in this case. In addition, a simple transformation of the response, commonly used in linear regression, can improve predictive performance of both the linear and non-parametric models.},

abstract = {Urban hydrology has evolved to improve the way urban runoff is managed for flood protection, public health and environmental protection. There have been significant recent advances in the measurement and prediction of urban rainfall, with technologies such as radar and microwave networks showing promise. The ability to predict urban hydrology has also evolved, to deliver models suited to the small temporal and spatial scales typical of urban and peri-urban applications. Urban stormwater management increasingly consider the needs of receiving environments as well as those of humans. There is a clear trend towards approaches that attempt to restore pre-development flow-regimes and water quality, with an increasing recognition that restoring a more natural water balance benefits not only the environment, but enhances the liveability of the urban landscape. Once regarded only as a nuisance, stormwater is now increasingly regarded as a resource. Despite the advances, many important challenges in urban hydrology remain. Further research into the spatio-temporal dynamics of urban rainfall is required to improve short-term rainfall prediction. The performance of stormwater technologies in restoring the water balance and in removing emerging priority pollutants remain poorly quantified. All of these challenges are overlaid by the uncertainty of climate change, which imposes a requirement to ensure that stormwater management systems are adaptable and resilient to changes. Urban hydrology will play a critical role in addressing these challenges. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Recent changes in peoples' lifestyles have contributed to a perceived improvement in their quality of life. However, this advance has been accompanied by a reduction in outdoor activities and reflected in issues of human health and well-being. When designing and creating a working or living space, the provision of thermal comfort for a building's occupants remains a significant objective but can be difficult to accurately quantify throughout design. Current demand for higher energy efficiency and improved indoor thermal comfort within the buildings sector have led to the use of Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS) tools. These powerful analytical tools allow evaluation of the indoor environment and energy performance at different stages of a building's life-cycle. However, integrating BEPS with Building Information Modelling (BIM)- based building design tools is still limited due to a lack of standardised methods of information exchange between these domains. The paper presents a Model View Definition (MVD), or subset of BIM relevant to a particular business process, for thermal comfort evaluation using conventional BEPS tools. In doing so, this work allows a standardised exchange of data from BIM to BEPS tools, for instance EnergyPlus. The role of MVD is to extract the necessary data for this exchange process in order to achieve optimum and reliable results of thermal comfort, in adherence with the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard.},

The necessity and feasibility of such a new approach are discussed. From an ecological point of view all components of the global system, including residents living in cities, have the same right to enjoy rainwater. Therefore, urban rainwater should neither be simply drained as waste water, nor be completely harvested as a kind of resource. The objective of this new approach is to maintain the natural hydrological cycle in urban areas during urbanization. When necessary, it could also be used to regulate the amount of runoff, evaporation and infiltration in a city in order to rehabilitate the hydrological cycle given the local conditions. Three basic principles should be adopted in rainwater management, i.e., separation of rainfall from sewage, limited utilization and small and decentralized facilities. Four methods can be used for urban rainwater management: rainwater harvest, rainwater infiltration, rainwater storage and rainwater pipes. The natural hydrological cycle in urban areas could be rehabilitated through rainwater management, which is of great importance for sustainable development of our cities. ?? 2007 The Journal of China University of Mining {\&} Technology.},

Over the last decades, a number of tools and methods have been developed to address performance-related design questions, mostly using Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithms. Parametric modelling offers dynamic control over geometry and components, allowing the designer to assess multiple variants at the same time. In this paper, a new design workflow methodology is proposed, integrating evolutionary algorithms and energy simulation through Grasshopper for Rhinoceros 3d, for a comprehensive exploration of performance-based design alternatives in the building scale.},

abstract = {Successful building design is becoming an increasingly complex task, due to a growing demand to satisfy more ambitious environmental, societal and economical performance requirements. The application of climate adaptive building shells (CABS) has recently been put forward as a promising alternative within this strive for higher levels of sustainability in the built environment. Compared to conventional fa{\c{c}}ades, CABS offer potential opportunities for energy savings as well improvement of indoor environmental quality. By combining the complementary beneficial aspects of both active and passive building technologies into the building envelope, CABS can draw upon the concepts of adaptability, multi-ability and evolvability. The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of research, design and development efforts in the field of CABS. Based on a structured literature review, a classification of 44 CABS is made to place the variety of concepts in context with each other, and concurrent developments. In doing so, the overall motivations, enabling technologies, and characteristic features that have contributed to the development of CABS are highlighted. Despite the positive perspectives, it was found that the concept of CABS cannot yet be considered mature. Future research needs and further challenges to be resolved are therefore identified as well.},

abstract = {It is known that building performance usually involves different criteria such as the energy consumption, thermal comfort, thermal loads and internal temperatures, which can make its assessment more complex. Thus, this paper aims to describe a decision-making process to improve some criteria related to the energy efficiency of residential buildings considering a multicriteria approach. Computer simulation using EnergyPlus v8.3-2014 was performed to assess the thermal and energy performance of a residential building for four different climates in Brazil (Bel{\'{e}}m, Campo Grande, Curitiba and Florian{\'{o}}polis). The performance criteria were the degree-hours and energy consumption for air-conditioning (both for heating and cooling) in different decision makers' preference scenarios. The performances of eight constructive systems were evaluated considering uncertainties related to the operational variables of the building, obtained through field survey. The results showed that some systems had statistically equivalent performance considering the range of uncertainty. The system of masonry with double massive brickwork performed better for three climates; for Bel{\'{e}}m, however, an adequate system highly depends on the preference scenario. Nonetheless, different preference scenarios would indicate different adequate systems for all climates. This study used a method of decision-making which enables the possibility for future analyses of other performance alternatives, design variables, and performance criteria.},

We classify the existing literature broadly into two categories, viz. static and adaptive design of experiments (DoE). We begin with the abundant literature available on static DoE, its chronological evolution, and its pros and cons. Our discussion naturally points to the challenges that are faced by the static techniques. The adaptive DoE techniques employ intelligent and iterative strategies to address these challenges by combining system knowledge with space-filling for sample placement. We critically analyze the adaptive DoE literature based on the key features of placement strategies. Our numerical and visual analyses of the static DoE techniques reveal the excellent performance of Sobol sampling (SOB3) for higher dimensions; and that of Hammersley (HAM) and Halton (HAL) sampling for lower dimensions. Finally, we provide several potential opportunities for the future modern DoE research. },

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis plays an important role in building energy analysis. It can be used to identify the key variables affecting building thermal performance from both energy simulation models and observational study. This paper is focused on the application of sensitivity analysis in the field of building performance analysis. First, the typical steps of implementation of sensitivity analysis in building analysis are described. A number of practical issues in applying sensitivity analysis are also discussed, such as the determination of input variations, the choice of building energy programs, how to reduce computational time for energy models. Second, the sensitivity analysis methods used in building performance analysis are reviewed. These methods can be categorized into local and global sensitivity analysis. The global methods can be further divided into four approaches: regression, screening-based, variance-based, and meta-model sensitivity analysis. Recent research has been concentrated on global methods because they can explore the whole input space and most of them allow the self-verification, i.e., how much variance of the model output (building energy consumption) has been explained by the method used in the analysis. Third, we discuss several important topics, which are often overlooked in the domain of building performance analysis. These topics include the application of sensitivity analysis in observational study, how to deal with correlated inputs, the computation of the variations of sensitivity index, and the software issues. Lastly, the practical guidance is given based on the advantages and disadvantaged of different sensitivity analysis methods in assessing building thermal performance. The recommendations for further research in the future are made to provide more robust analysis in assessing building energy performance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The rapidly growing world energy use has already raised concerns over supply difficulties, exhaustion of energy resources and heavy environmental impacts (ozone layer depletion, global warming, climate change, etc.). The global contribution from buildings towards energy consumption, both residential and commercial, has steadily increased reaching figures between 20{\%} and 40{\%} in developed countries, and has exceeded the other major sectors: industrial and transportation. Growth in population, increasing demand for building services and comfort levels, together with the rise in time spent inside buildings, assure the upward trend in energy demand will continue in the future. For this reason, energy efficiency in buildings is today a prime objective for energy policy at regional, national and international levels. Among building services, the growth in HVAC systems energy use is particularly significant (50{\%} of building consumption and 20{\%} of total consumption in the USA). This paper analyses available information concerning energy consumption in buildings, and particularly related to HVAC systems. Many questions arise: Is the necessary information available? Which are the main building types? What end uses should be considered in the breakdown? Comparisons between different countries are presented specially for commercial buildings. The case of offices is analysed in deeper detail. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Spain has one of the highest risks of water shortage due mainly to the growth of the urban population, the development of different economic activities, such as tourism, in regions with major hydrological constraints and under the effect of global climate change. Government authorities and public and private institutions have stressed the need to develop alternative water supplies to respond to the growing demand in cities, which are home to more than 70{\%} of Spain's population. Rainwater constitutes an alternative water supply for uses that require lower quality than that provided by tap water. Although there are financial-feasibility studies and other studies on the potential environmental impacts of Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) systems, there is no integration between these studies that allows for rapid assessment tools for these systems that can be used by planners and decision makers. This study shows that it is possible to model both conventional financial indicators (Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return) and indicators of potential environmental impact (Global Warming Potential and Energy Use) using linear systems and an appropriate sizing scale for the majority of RWH systems. Some positive financial results of this study indicate negative environmental performance in some configurations of RWH systems. In addition, providing rainwater to meet domestic water demand for washing machines has a lower impact than using tap water. The determining factor in the design of RWH systems is the scale of the system, where the neighbourhood scale is the best alternative. The material used for storage tanks is not an outstanding factor. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency is a central target for energy policy and a keystone for sustainable development. However, the lack of a valid set of energy efficiency indicators (EEI) sufficiently accurate, robust and repeatable is significantly affecting the success of such policies and causing no little confusion and speculation on this field. Therefore, it appears to be essential to identify suitable methods to measure energy efficiency and to achieve consensus over the use of a valid set of EEI. This paper reviews the definition of efficiency and its quantification. First, a methodology is introduced in order to construct EEI. This methodology is applied to heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and an exhaustive classification of EEI is proposed at four levels: global, service, subsystem and equipment. A new 'subsystems approach' is introduced for the energy analysis of HVAC systems based on generation efficiency, transportation specific consumption and the 'demand ratio', a new measure of HVAC thermal energy efficiency. Finally, we present a case study to illustrate the application of the proposed EEI to HVAC systems and to show the main advantages of the 'subsystems approach'. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

It is shown that the processing time savings obtained with the automation process increase exponentially as the number of design factors considered increases.

abstract = {Climatic zoning is an essential element of most building energy efficiency programs, however there is no widely accepted scientific technique for its delineation. This paper reports an investigation on this issue, which comprised the review of climatic zoning methodologies for building energy efficiency programs adopted by 54 countries. The paper identified that the nature and magnitude of climatic variations are not the main elements in the definition of the number of climatic zones in a country. The number of climatic zones seems to be mainly driven by the expected simplicity of the final climatic zoning, respecting in most cases a maximum of 8 zones independent of the country size and climatic variations. A total of 19 different variables, techniques and parameters used in climatic zoning were identified, the most frequent being temperature, degree days, altitude, administrative divisions and relative humidity. However, around 80{\%} of the countries analysed in this study used only up to three variables/techniques/parameters to define their climatic zoning. This simplicity comes at the cost of ignoring several aspects of climate and building energy performance. From the techniques identified in this review, only the combination of building performance simulation and cluster analysis seems to provide robust tools to tackle the complex relations between climate and building energy performance. Combined, these tools may provide the means to explore scenarios and support evidence-based decision making in energy policy. The lack of consensus in several aspects of climate zoning indicates the need for further research in this area.},

abstract = {Designing envelope configurations of office building with the low construction cost and energy consumption is a discrete optimization problem. The configuration is currently determined merely on architects' experiences resulting in an inefficient expense or by building energy performance simulation which is time-intensive and involves complex processes. Based on an efficient regression equation to substitute complex energy simulators, this study developed an Office Building envelope Energy performance and configuration Model (OBEM) to provide envelope configurations, including construction material, sunshade type, sunshade length, window number, and window length and width for architects' reference. Also, Tabu search, which is effective in solving discrete optimization problems, was integrated with OBEM into an Optimal OBEM decision support system (OPOBEM). The OPOBEM was applied to a real office building construction for optimizing its envelope configuration at minimum construction budget under the energy conservation regulations of green buildings. The result shows that the optimized installation of sunshade type efficiently reduces solar heat gain according to the high variation of the sunshade coefficient, thus achieves the goal of energy conservation and reduces the envelope costs. Compared with architects' manual estimation, the optimized envelope design realizes nearly 41{\%} budget savings, thus demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed OPOBEM.},

Sensitivity analysis is an essential tool in the development of robust models for engineering, physical sciences, economics and policy-making, but typically requires running the model a large number of times in order to estimate sensitivity measures. While statistical emulators allow sensitivity analysis even on complex models, they only perform well with a moderately low number of model inputs: in higher dimensional problems they tend to require a restrictively high number of model runs unless the model is relatively linear. Therefore, an open question is how to tackle sensitivity problems in higher dimensionalities, at very low sample sizes. This article examines the relative performance of four sampling-based measures which can be used in such high-dimensional nonlinear problems. The measures tested are the Sobol' total sensitivity indices, the absolute mean of elementary effects, a derivative-based global sensitivity measure, and a modified derivative-based measure. Performance is assessed in a ‘screening' context, by assessing the ability of each measure to identify influential and non-influential inputs on a wide variety of test functions at different dimensionalities. The results show that the best-performing measure in the screening context is dependent on the model or function, but derivative-based measures have a significant potential at low sample sizes that is currently not widely recognised.},

abstract = {Several recent advances to the state of the art in image classification benchmarks have come from better configurations of existing techniques rather than novel ap-proaches to feature learning. Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efficient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it pos-sible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can find better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neu-ral networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the ex-pected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufficiently efficient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreli-able for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difficult DBN learning problems from [1] and find significantly better results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques for making response surface models P (y|x) in which many elements of hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values of other elements.},

abstract = {The impacts of building envelope design factors upon cooling and heating loads in US cities of different climate zones were quantitatively analyzed using a fractional factorial experimental design. This analysis yielded regression models of the energy loads as functions of the factors considered. The relative importance of building envelope design factors for an office building was statistically compared. The design factors were classified into three groups: (1) a factor directly affected by insolation, SHGC; (2) another group affecting heat transmission based upon the temperature difference between the indoors and the outdoors, WDI, WI, and ACR; and (3) another group affecting the effective area for heat transfer, WWR, AR, FA, CH, and PH. Unique phenomena in different climate zones were further investigated considering the weather features in those zones. Pareto-front curves of cooling and heating loads were obtained, yielding information on optimal design factor sets in the different climate zones. The reasons for the variation in optimal sets of design factors along the Pareto fronts are explicitly explained in terms of the main effects and interaction effects of the design factors.},

@article{Menezes2012c,
abstract = {With the increasing demand for more energy efficient buildings, the construction industry is faced with the challenge to ensure that the energy performance predicted during the design stage is achieved once a building is in use. There is, however, significant evidence to suggest that buildings are not performing as well as expected and initiatives such as PROBE and CarbonBuzz aim to illustrate the extent of this so called 'performance gap'. This paper discusses the underlying causes of discrepancies between energy modelling predictions and in-use performance of occupied buildings (after the twelve month liability period). Many of the causal factors relate to the use of unrealistic input parameters regarding occupancy behaviour and facilities management in building energy models. In turn, this is associated with the lack of feedback to designers once a building has been constructed and occupied. The paper aims to demonstrate how knowledge acquired from Post-Occupancy Evaluation (POE) can be used to produce more accurate energy performance models. A case study focused specifically on lighting, small power and catering equipment in a high density office building is analysed and presented. Results show that by combining monitoring data with predictive energy modelling, it was possible to increase the accuracy of the model to within 3{\%} of actual electricity consumption values. Future work will seek to use detailed POE data to develop a set of evidence based benchmarks for energy consumption in office buildings. It is envisioned that these benchmarks will inform designers on the impact of occupancy and management on the actual energy consumption of buildings. Moreover, it should enable the use of more realistic input parameters in energy models, bringing the predicted figures closer to reality. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to present a method to optimize the equivalent thermophysical properties of the external walls (thermal conductivity kwalland volumetric specific heat ($\rho$c)wall) of a dwelling in order to improve its thermal efficiency. Classical optimization involves several dynamic yearly thermal simulations, which are commonly quite time consuming. To reduce the computational requirements, we have adopted a methodology that couples an artificial neural network and the genetic algorithm NSGA-II. This optimization technique has been applied to a dwelling for two French climates, Nancy (continental) and Nice (Mediterranean). We have chosen to characterize the energy performance of the dwelling with two criteria, which are the optimization targets: the annual energy consumption QTOTand the summer comfort degree Isum. First, using a design of experiments, we have quantified and analyzed the impact of the variables kwalland ($\rho$c)wallon the objectives QTOTand Isum, depending on the climate. Then, the optimal Pareto fronts obtained from the optimization are presented and analyzed. The optimal solutions are compared to those from mono-objective optimization by using an aggregative method and a constraint problem in GenOpt. The comparison clearly shows the importance of performing multi-objective optimization. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Fitting is carried out using nonlinear weighted least squares optimization. The fitted model is then used to predict the classifier's performance and confidence interval for larger sample sizes. For evaluation, the nonlinear weighted curve fitting method was applied to a set of learning curves generated using clinical text and waveform classification tasks with active and passive sampling methods, and predictions were validated using standard goodness of fit measures. As control we used an un-weighted fitting method.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 568 models were fitted and the model predictions were compared with the observed performances.

The Weibull model allows the investigator to specify a group difference in terms of a hazards ratio or a failure time ratio. We consider exponential, Weibull and uniformly distributed censoring distributions. We base our power calculations on a parametric approach with the Wald test because it is easy for medical investigators to conceptualize and specify the required input variables. As expected, studies with current status data have substantially less power than studies with the usual right-censored failure time data.

This paper reviews energy related aspects of HVAC systems with the aim of establishing a common ground for the analysis of their energy efficiency. The paper focuses on the map of energy flow to deliver thermal comfort: the HVAC energy chain. Our approach deals first with thermal comfort as the final service delivered to building occupants. Secondly, conditioned spaces are examined as the systems where useful heat (or coolth) is degraded to provide comfort. This is followed by the analysis of HVAC systems as complex energy conversion devices where energy carriers are transformed into useful heat and coolth, and finally, the impact of HVAC energy consumption on energy resources is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In our design, SRTs are connected via a network that enables monitoring data to be collected and pump-control commands to be issued to individual tanks. These connected tanks form part of a rainwater grid system (RGS). It will also be possible to monitor rainfall amount using the RGS since it functions as a high-resolution rain gauge. This is important because Heavy rainfall can cause serious attenuation of the reflectivity of rain cells monitored by X-band multi-parameter (MP) weather radar networks. A prototype SRT system has been installed in a gravel-filled 110 tons underground tank in the Oginoura Garden Suburb, which is a maisonette-type housing complex, where its functions are now being tested. Initial results indicate that measuring rainfall using the gravel-filled underground tank is not suitable due to spikes in the water level after a heavy rainfall event has occurred. So, we decide to install a void type of 5.6 tons rainwater tank to the personal house for Moriyama. It will be installed a sensors at the first quarter of 2016. For pre-discharge of rainwater before heavy rainfall, diagnosis for heavy rainfall by using SOM is installed. This diagnosis is installed on “Internet Cloud” and possible to send a order to SRTs with pumps. The accuracy of diagnosis for heavy rainfall is investigated, but it is only for Aug. 2014, it should be more investigation.},

Implementing passive design techniques for these buildings is not a simple task in most dense cities; their energy performance usually depends on uncertainties in the local climate and many building parameters, such as window size, zone height, and features of materials. For this paper, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the most significant parameters for buildings in hot-humid climates by considering the design of an existing apartment building in Izmir, Turkey. The Monte Carlo method is selected for sensitivity and uncertainty analyses with the Latin hypercube sampling (LHC) technique. The results show that the sensitivity of parameters in apartment buildings varies based on the purpose of the energy loads and locations in the building, such as the ground, intermediate, and top floors. In addition, the total window area, the heat transfer coefficient (U) and the solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) of the glazing based on the orientation have the most considerable influence on the energy performance of apartment buildings in hot-humid climates. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Rainwater harvesting has been studied in different countries as a way of easing water availability problems and reducing potable water demand in buildings. The most important factor relating to the efficiency of a rainwater system is the correct sizing of the rainwater tank. Therefore, the objective of this article is to assess the influence of rainfall, roof area, number of residents, potable water demand and rainwater demand on rainwater tank sizing. The analysis was performed by using computer simulation and by considering daily rainfall data for three cities located in the state of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil. The roof areas considered were 50, 100, 200 and 400 m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}; the potable water demands were 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 l per capita per day; the rainwater demands were taken as a percentage of the potable water demand, i.e., 10{\%} to 100{\%} at increments of 10{\%}; and the number of residents was two and four. Results indicated a wide variation of rainwater tank sizes for each city and also for each parameter. The main conclusion that can be made from the study is that rainwater tank sizing for houses must be performed for each specific situation, i.e., considering local rainfall, roof area, potable water demand, rainwater demand and number of residents. Therefore, sizing rainwater tanks according to local tradition is not recommended as it may incur low efficiency.

abstract = {The employ of thermal insulation is one of the most effective ways of building energy conservation for cooling and heating. Therefore, the selection of a proper insulation material and the determination of optimum insulation thickness are particularly vital. Four typical cities of Shanghai, Changsha, Shaoguan and Chengdu are selected to represent A, B, C and D subzone of hot summer and cold winter zone in China, respectively. The optimum thicknesses of five insulation materials including expanded polystyrene, extruded polystyrene, foamed polyurethane, perlite and foamed polyvinyl chloride are calculated with a typical residential wall using solar-air cooling and heating degree-days analysis and P1-P2 economic model. And then, life cycle total costs, life cycle savings and payback periods are calculated based on life cycle cost analysis. Considering different orientations, surface colors, insulation materials and climates, optimum thicknesses of the five insulations vary from 0.053 to 0.236 m, and the payback periods vary from 1.9 to 4.7 years over a lifetime of 20 years. The maximum life cycle savings are 54.4 {\$}/m2 in Shanghai, 54.8 {\$}/m2 in Changsha and 41.5 {\$}/m2 in Shaoguan (with a deep-colored northeast wall), and 39.0 {\$}/m2 in Chengdu (with a light-colored northwest wall). Finally, an approach to analyze economical efficiency of insulation materials is developed, result shows that expanded polystyrene is the most economic insulation material of the five because of the highest life cycle saving and lowest payback period. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Daylighting has a recognized potential for electric energy savings when used as a complement for artificial lighting. Recent studies have indicated that artificial neural networks (ANNs) present high potential for daylighting analysis in buildings. In this study, a statistical performance method based on ANNs is evaluated. The ANN use is assessed in comparison with the multivariate linear regression (MLR) technique in order to represent the potential for energy savings through the daylighting use in office buildings. The data set was based on computer simulation results obtained with 216 models and used to develop a MLR equation. The simulations were performed with Daysim (daylighting) coupled to EnergyPlus (energy). In parallel, an approximation model using ANN was applied. The method adopted for the training and validation of the ANN was a cross-validation procedure, recommended for limited data sets. The results demonstrate that the ANN have shown a better performance in representing this problem, since it presented a lower coefficient of determination and an acceptable mean square error. In addition, the ANNs presented learning skills which allow them to perform the generalization process in a better way. After being validated, the ANN is expected to provide output results for input data which have not yet been submitted to it, providing reasonable estimates of daylighting impact on electric energy need for new environments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Current literature holds various examples of investigations that make use of a building energy model (BEM) combined with a sensitivity analysis (SA) technique to identify and rank the BEM input parameters that the model output is most sensitive to. However, a sound argumentation that vouches for the reliability, validity and necessary complexity of the chosen SA method for the specific purpose of the BEM-based analysis, is rare. This paper reports on an investigation of how two different levels of a-priori information about input parameters, applied to three different SA methods (Local, Morris and Sobol), influenced the identification and ranking of the input parameters that the annual energy need output of a quasi-steady-state BEM using monthly time steps, and a simple dynamic BEM using hourly time steps, is most sensitive to. It was found that the three SA methods, to a great extent, were able to identify the same cluster of most sensitive input parameters, independent of the level of a-priori input parameter information and BEM. However, the ranking of most sensitive input parameters varied with the applied SA method, BEM, and level of a-priori input parameter information. From a practical point of view, the choice of appropriate SA method is concluded to depend on the purpose of the SA analysis.},

abstract = {With the increasing demand for more energy efficient buildings, the construction industry is faced with the challenge to ensure that the energy performance predicted during the design stage is achieved once a building is in use. There is, however, significant evidence to suggest that buildings are not performing as well as expected and initiatives such as PROBE and CarbonBuzz aim to illustrate the extent of this so called 'performance gap'. This paper discusses the underlying causes of discrepancies between energy modelling predictions and in-use performance of occupied buildings (after the twelve month liability period). Many of the causal factors relate to the use of unrealistic input parameters regarding occupancy behaviour and facilities management in building energy models. In turn, this is associated with the lack of feedback to designers once a building has been constructed and occupied. The paper aims to demonstrate how knowledge acquired from Post-Occupancy Evaluation (POE) can be used to produce more accurate energy performance models. A case study focused specifically on lighting, small power and catering equipment in a high density office building is analysed and presented. Results show that by combining monitoring data with predictive energy modelling, it was possible to increase the accuracy of the model to within 3{\%} of actual electricity consumption values. Future work will seek to use detailed POE data to develop a set of evidence based benchmarks for energy consumption in office buildings. It is envisioned that these benchmarks will inform designers on the impact of occupancy and management on the actual energy consumption of buildings. Moreover, it should enable the use of more realistic input parameters in energy models, bringing the predicted figures closer to reality. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {There often is a significant difference between predicted (computed) energy performance of buildings and actual measured energy use once buildings are operational. This article reviews literature on this 'performance gap'. It discerns three main types of gap: (1) between first-principle predictions and measurements, (2) between machine learning and measurements, and (3) between predictions and display certificates in legislation. It presents a pilot study that attempts an initial probabilistic probe into the performance gap. Findings from this pilot study are used to identify a number of key issues that need to be addressed within future investigations of the performance gap in general, especially the fact that the performance gap is a function of time and external conditions. The paper concludes that the performance gap can only be bridged by a broad, coordinated approach that combines model validation and verification, improved data collection for predictions, better forecasting, and change of industry practice. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Harmful algal blooms, which are considered a serious environmental problem nowadays, occur in coastal waters in many parts of the world. They cause acute ecological damage and ensuing economic losses, due to fish kills and shellfish poisoning as well as public health threats posed by toxic blooms. Recently, data-driven models including machine-learning (ML) techniques have been employed to mimic dynamics of algal blooms. One of the most important steps in the application of a ML technique is the selection of significant model input variables. In the present paper, we use two extensively used ML techniques, artificial neural networks (ANN) and genetic programming (GP) for selecting the significant input variables. The efficacy of these techniques is first demonstrated on a test problem with known dependence and then they are applied to a real-world case study of water quality data from Tolo Harbour, Hong Kong. These ML techniques overcome some of the limitations of the currently used techniques for input variable selection, a review of which is also presented. The interpretation of the weights of the trained ANN and the GP evolved equations demonstrate their ability to identify the ecologically significant variables precisely. The significant variables suggested by the ML techniques also indicate chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) itself to be the most significant input in predicting the algal blooms, suggesting an auto-regressive nature or persistence in the algal bloom dynamics, which may be related to the long flushing time in the semi-enclosed coastal waters. The study also confirms the previous understanding that the algal blooms in coastal waters of Hong Kong often occur with a life cycle of the order of 1-2 weeks. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted {\~{}}50,000 detailed energy and airflow simulations in 427 locations across Brazil, varying 55 parameters representing building morphology, fenestration, construction properties, internal gains, operating times, wind modifiers, flowpaths, window control, and soil traits. Comfort performance was quantified by the average annual fraction of occupied hours that exceeded the upper limit of an adaptive comfort zone, and investigated with sensitivity analysis and machine learning methods. Results indicated that, after climate, building size (both footprint area and number of stories) and internal gains were most influential and were positively associated with discomfort. Adding air movement with ceiling fans and providing for night ventilation both proved highly effective comfort interventions. Except for roof solar absorptance, opaque envelope changes, including increasing insulation or thermal mass, had only marginal impacts. A support vector regression metamodel, requiring 29 easily obtainable inputs plus a weather file, was fit to the simulation results and successfully validated (R2= 0.97). The metamodel was developed as a simplified compliance path for naturally ventilated buildings to enhance Brazil's commercial building performance labeling program, which, because it currently provides such a path only for air conditioned buildings, may discouraging decision-makers from considering even more efficient passive solutions. We use a case study to show how the metamodel, which we will distribute publicly, can also serve as a design tool, and demonstrate that modifying a small set of parameters can drastically improve thermal performance and achieve sustainable comfort in hot and warm climates.},

They find that, on average, LEED buildings use 18-39{\%} less energy per floor area than their conventional counterparts, consistent with and adding clarity to conclusions originally reached by NBI. These conclusions, however, hang on a particular definition of the mean energy intensity of a collection of buildings that is not related to the total energy used by those buildings. Furthermore, site energy considered by Newsham et al. and NBI, unlike source energy used for the EPA's building Energy Star rating, does not account for the energy consumed off-site in generating and delivering electric energy to the building, whose inclusion is crucial for understanding greenhouse gas emission associated with building operation. Here I demonstrate that both the site energy and source energy used by the set of 35 LEED office buildings and Newsham et al.'s matching CBECS office buildings are statistically equivalent. Hence Newsham et al. offer no evidence that LEED-certification has collectively lowered either site or source energy for office buildings. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Multi-disciplinary collaboration is considered necessary for solving complex designs, and belief in its merits is unequivocal in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) literature. However, this paper argues that collaboration is a challenging endeavour that entails creating a unified platform for professionals to converge. Challenges are compounded when the collaboration is for building performance assessments, as architects' and Building Performance Simulation (BPS) consultants' worldviews are divergent. This paper presents part of a mixed-methods study investigating collaborative relationships between architects and BPS consultants. Questionnaires are designed to re-test non-technical barriers in collaboration, described during preceding interviews. Six salient factors representing barriers impeding fruitful collaborations are extracted, and inter-relationships are explored using inferential statistics. Barriers include perceptions about architects' attitudes toward BPS, using BPS for compliance, trust and communication between architects and consultants. Finally, this research illustrates how recourse to methodologies from outside the traditional BPS realm may open new research avenues in this field.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an efficient methodology for the simulation-based multi-objective optimization problems, which addresses important limitations for the optimization of the building energy performance. In this work, a mono- and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is coupled with EnergyPlus building energy simulation software to find a set of non-dominated solutions to enhance the building energy performance. To evaluate the capability and effectiveness of the approach, the developed method is applied to a single room model, and the effect of building architectural parameters including, the building orientation, the shading overhang specifications, the window size, and the glazing and the wall material properties on the building energy consumption are studied in four major climatic regions of Iran. In the optimization section, mono-criterion and multi-criteria optimization analyses of the annual cooling, heating, and lighting electricity consumption are examined to understand interactions between the objective functions and to minimize the annual total building energy demand. The achieved optimum solutions from the multi-objective optimization process are also reported as Pareto optimal fronts. Finally, the result of multi-criteria minimization is compared with the mono-criterion ones. The results of the triple-objective optimization problem point out that for our typical model, the annual cooling electricity decreases about 19.8-33.3{\%}; while the annual heating and lighting ones increase 1.7-4.8{\%} and 0.5-2.6{\%}, respectively, in comparison to the baseline model for four diverse climatic regions of Iran. In addition, the optimum design leads to 1.6-11.3{\%} diminution of the total annual building electricity demand. The proposed optimization method shows a powerful and useful tool that can save time while searching for the optimal solutions with conflicting objective functions; therefore facilitate decision making in early phases of a building design in order to enhance its energy efficiency.},

This paper introduces to the concept of reference buildings and to the state of art at an international level. In particular, a general methodology for the creation of reference buildings is illustrated. A case study of an office building as a reference building for the Italian existing building stock is then shown. The process concerning the building definition and modeling was carried out by means of dynamic energy simulation program EnergyPlus. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to combine sensitivity analysis and simulation-based optimisation in order to optimise the thermal and energy performance of residential buildings in the Argentine Littoral region. An actual house was selected as case study. This is a typical, local, single-family house having some rooms conditioned only by natural ventilation, and other rooms with natural ventilation supplemented by mechanical air-conditioning (hybrid ventilation). Hence, the total degree-hours at the naturally ventilated living room and the total energy consumption by air-conditioning at the bedrooms were chosen as objective functions to be minimised. The global objective function characterising the thermal and energy performance of the house was defined as the weighted sum of these objective functions. This objective function was computed using the EnergyPlus building performance simulation programme. Then, we performed a sensitivity analysis using the Morris screening method to rank the influence of the design variables on the objective function. This showed that the type of external walls, the windows infiltration rate and the solar azimuth were the most influential design variables on the given objective function for the considered house, and also that the azimuth either had a highly nonlinear effect on the objective function or was highly correlated to the others variables, deserving in any case a finer discretisation. Finally, we solved an optimisation problem using genetic algorithms in order to find the optimal set of design variables for the considered house. The results highlighted the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed methodology to redesign a typical house in the Argentine Littoral region, improving hugely its thermal and energy performance.},

Non-linear regression using `neural networks' is a popular technique for such modeling tasks. Since it is not obvious how large a time-window of inputs is appropriate, or what preprocessing of inputs is best, this can be viewed as a regression problem in which there are many possible input variables, some of which may actually be irrelevant to the prediction of the output variable. Because a finite data set will show random correlations between the irrelevant inputs and the output, any conventional neural network (even with regularisation or `weight decay') will not set the coefficients for these junk inputs to zero. Thus the irrelevant variables will hurt the model's performance. The Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) model puts a prior over the regression parameters which embodies the concept of relevance.

We find that while benchmarking systems are developed by using the energy-use performance of a significant number of reference buildings, benchmarking results can be used to encourage poor reference performers (in energy-efficiency) to improve their performance. On the other hand, because benchmarking systems also function as a public yardstick of energy-use performance in buildings, some regulators release benchmarking information to the media. This proves advantageous because it brings public pressure on owners/developers of poorly performing non-reference buildings. However, not all benchmarking systems can be used by public users (i.e., other non-reference building owners). Depending on whether the resulting benchmarking system can be used in public, we note that there are two kinds of benchmarking system: public benchmarking and internal benchmarking. These two types of benchmarking system are developed by different methods. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Moreover, several visualizations for the SA results are introduced, such as input pair importance color matrix and variable effect characteristic surface. A wide range of experiments was performed in order to test the SA methods and measures by fitting four well-known models (NN, SVM, RF and decision trees) to synthetic datasets (five regression and five classification tasks).

abstract = {It is common knowledge that buildings should be constructed with good envelopes and sufficient masses. However, U.S. building codes make no provision for a building's thermal mass. This may result from that the conventional heat balance design—which assumes constant indoor air temperature, any heat imbalance resulting from corresponding envelope heat loss or gain and internal heat gain is accounted for by HVAC equipment—aims for HVAC selection, not for determining required building thermal qualities. We propose the concept of building thermal autonomy and a two-step process assumption-based design method. Thermal autonomy is a building's capability of keeping its indoor temperature sans HVAC equipment within a prescribed temperature range. The first step of the process assumption-based design method aims for the determination of building thermal qualities for a thermally autonomous building. Our finding shows that optimum slab thickness for a building's ceilings and floors is 25-cm and recommends 10-cm thick concrete slabs for its envelope walls. More interesting is the finding that climate-specific factor of diurnal temperature amplitude should be taken into consideration in the envelope design: a maximum WWR (Window-to-Wall Ratio) is given as a function of diurnal temperature amplitude.},

abstract = {Buildings are major consumers of global energy resources. Approximately 80{\%} of the energy used in commercial office spaces, is typically used for maintaining optimal comfort levels through delivery of heating, cooling, ventilating, and lighting. Building Information Modelling (BIM) has seen a significant up- take by designers in pursuit of sustainable building designs. Furthermore, general BIM systems already con- tain much of the information that can be further reused for additional project tasks such as thermal comfort analysis. Integration and improvement of information flows between BIM and Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS) tools has the capacity to help designers assess building performance under various design conditions. In doing so, assessments of building performance and thermal comfort requires additional repre- sentative data about indoor environmental conditions and energy consumption. The process of connecting BIM to energy simulation tools, for the explicit purpose of thermal comfort analysis, requires a well-defined Model View Definition (MVD). MVDs define a subset of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema, which is needed to support a particular business process. This paper develops a MVD for thermal comfort that represents the data needed by building designers or operators to deliver a satisfactory level of thermal comfort in a typical small, single occupant office. The use case consists of a single thermal zone with a HVAC system. The detailed specification for these requirements is based on the IFC data representation. The IfcDoc application tool is used to improve the consistency and define computer-interpretable definition of the MVD. The outputs of this work will allow a standardised exchange of the necessary requirements from BIM to BEPS tools (e.g. EnergyPlus) for thermal comfort analysis.},

abstract = {An integrated framework for density-based cluster analysis, outlier detection, and data visualization is introduced in this article. The main module consists of an algorithm to compute hierarchical estimates of the level sets of a density, following Hartigan's classic model of density-contour clusters and trees. Such an algorithm generalizes and improves existing density-based clustering techniques with respect to different aspects. It provides as a result a complete clustering hierarchy composed of all possible density-based clusters following the nonparametricmodel adopted, for an infinite range of density thresholds. The resulting hierarchy can be easily processed so as to provide multiple ways for data visualization and exploration. It can also be further postprocessed so that: (i) a normalized score of “outlierness” can be assigned to each data object, which unifies both the global and local perspectives of outliers into a single definition; and (ii) a “flat” (i.e., nonhierarchical) clustering solution composed of clusters extracted from local cuts through the cluster tree (possibly corresponding to different density thresholds) can be obtained, either in an unsupervised or in a semisupervised way. In the unsupervised scenario, the algorithm corresponding to this postprocessing module provides a global, optimal solution to the formal problem of maximizing the overall stability of the extracted clusters. If partially labeled objects or instance-level constraints are provided by the user, the algorithm can solve the problem by considering both constraints violations/satisfactions and cluster stability criteria. An asymptotic complexity analysis, both in terms of running time and memory space, is described. Experiments are reported that involve a variety of synthetic and real datasets, including comparisons with state-of-the-art, density-based clustering and (global and local) outlier detection methods.},

This study investigates into the influence of an existence of the thermal insulation layer in the outside walls on the yearly cooling load and yearly maximum cooling demand in two typical residential flats in a high-rise residential building by employing HTB2, detailed building heat transfer simulation software. During the investigations, the thermal insulation layer up to 15 cm thick was placed either at the inside, or at the outside, or at the middle part of the outside wall structure. Then, the concrete layer was up to 40 cm thick. The simulation predictions indicate that the highest decrease in the yearly cooling load of up to 6.8{\%} is obtained when a 5 cm thick thermal insulation layer faces the inside of the residential flat. The highest decrease in the yearly maximum cooling demand of 7.3{\%} is recorded when a 5 cm thermal insulation layer faces either the outside or the inside of the flat; this depends on the flat orientation. However, much weaker reductions in the yearly cooling load and yearly maximum cooling demand are found when the thickness of thermal insulation is increased above 5 cm and the thickness of concrete is increased above 10 cm. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss the benefits derived by combining parametric modeling and genetic algorithms to achieve a performance oriented process in design, with specific focus on architectural design. The key role played by geometry in architecture is discussed in relation to performance oriented design, in which evaluations based on engineering criteria are integrated into the conceptual phase of the design. The performance attained by a specific geometric solution is considered along with its complexity in an interdisciplinarity process. A specific case study using large roofs is presented as an example. Enabling the designer to automatically generate a large range of alternative design solutions is a great advantage offered by parametric modeling in supporting geometric design explorations. However, this in turn presents the difficulty of how to evaluate the resulting myriad of generated alternatives. ParaGen is presented as a tool to support the exploration of the parametric design alternatives. ParaGen combines parametric modeling, performance simulation software and genetic algorithms, together with a database to store and retrieve the solutions for subsequent exploration. The design exploration is enhanced by means of the interaction of the designer with the process. This serves two objectives. Firstly, it addresses the genetic algorithm based creation of design solutions, while still focusing on a given fitness function. Secondly, it facilitates knowledge extraction from the generated solutions. A description of the tool and its possible uses by designers is provided. Applications of this tool are illustrated for both education and research, with specific reference to two examples in the field of modular long span roofs. The first case study has been developed as part of a teaching exercise in which ParaGen is used to explore the morphology of a dome based on structural performance. The second case study is derived from a research project which deals with solar energy transmission, and concerns the solar heat gain and daylight transmittance of a long span roof. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Energy use in buildings is closely linked to their operational and space utilization characteristics and the behavior of their occupants. The occupant has influence due to his presence and activities in the building and due to his control actions that aim to improve indoor environmental conditions (thermal, air quality, light, noise). Due to the demand for sustainable buildings more passive buildings will be built. Consequently the weight of the user behavior on the energy balance of a building increases. In the design phase, e.g., via building performance simulation, this effect has only recently been recognized. In this study the effect of user behavior on building performance has been evaluated further to assess requirements for design solutions to arrive at buildings that are more robust to the influence of user behavior. In the research two recent developments with respect to user presence and user interactions in a building have been combined. The results indicate that for specific buildings user behavior should be assessed in more detail, to allow the building design to be optimized for the actual user and its peculiarities. A guideline supports the decision process.},

abstract = {In order to resolve the contradiction between the lack of building energy data and the need of more detailed information about energy performance, this paper presents a simplified building energy performance diagnosis method which can assess the energy performance from building level to system level with only limited information. Based on multiple-parameter regression between the whole building energy bills and outdoor weather data, the proposed diagnosis method uses the regression coefficients to identify the energy use of main systems (i.e., lighting-plug system and cooling/heating system), as well as other detailed information about physical properties of the building and cooling/heating system (i.e., cooling or heating load, the operation of cooling/heating system and the efficiency of cooling/heating system). One case study was conducted in an office building in China to test the application of this diagnosis method. In addition, the regression result of simulated energy consumption served as benchmark data to further diagnose the performance gap between the operation stage and the design stage and help locate the poor performance and key points of energy-saving. Finally, all diagnosis results have been verified by the performance data from advanced energy consumption monitoring system together with field surveys and measurements.},

abstract = {Retrofitting of existing buildings offers significant opportunities for improving occupants' comfort and well-being, reducing global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This is being considered as one of the main approaches to achieve sustainability in the built environment at relatively low cost and high uptake rates. Although a wide range of retrofit technologies is readily available, methods to identify the most suitable set of retrofit actions for particular projects are still a major technical and methodological challenge. This paper presents a multi-objective optimization model using genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial neural network (ANN) to quantitatively assess technology choices in a building retrofit project. This model combines the rapidity of evaluation of ANNs with the optimization power of GAs. A school building is used as a case study to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed approach and highlight potential problems that may arise. The study starts with the individual optimization of objective functions focusing on building's characteristics and performance: energy consumption, retrofit cost, and thermal discomfort hours. Then a multi-objective optimization model is developed to study the interaction between these conflicting objectives and assess their trade-offs. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The EnergyPlus models were created for assessing new technologies and supporting the development of energy codes in pursuing building energy efficiency improvements. These models employed an oversimplified approach to infiltration in which infiltration rates were input as constant values. A number of additional inputs had to be defined for the CONTAM models to realistically account for airflow, including the addition of several building zones. Annual airflow simulations were performed in CONTAM for six of the sixteen reference buildings. There are clear relationships between the infiltration rates calculated by CONTAM and weather, which are not exhibited in the EnergyPlus results. In addition, the building envelope airtightness values assumed in either approach have a major impact on calculated infiltration rates. The results of this study provide a baseline for subsequent use of these models to investigate design approaches and technologies that are intended to reduce building energy consumption, improve indoor air quality, or both.},

A database of thermal load ratios (i.e. the ratio of the free-form building's thermal load over the reference building's thermal load) was generated. Then, polynomial equations returning the envelope heat gain, heat loss, and solar heat gain ratios were derived as a function of window area ratio and exterior wall area ratio of a free-form building.

This paper presents results from an experimental and simulation study on comparative energy and economic performance of walls used to enclose air-conditioned spaces. The walls are externally and internally insulated to different thicknesses. The spaces are assumed to serve three commercial functions.

The methodology has been used in the current study for the optimization of thermal comfort and energy consumption in a residential house. Results of ANN training and validation are first discussed. Two optimizations were then conducted taking variables from HVAC system settings, thermostat programming, and passive solar design. By integrating ANN into optimization the total simulation time was considerably reduced compared to classical optimization methodology. Results of the optimizations showed significant reduction in terms of energy consumption as well as improvement in thermal comfort. Finally, thanks to the multiobjective approach, dozens of potential designs were revealed, with a wide range of trade-offs between thermal comfort and energy consumption. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.},

abstract = {In 1991 Morris proposed an effective screening sensitivity measure to identify the few important factors in models with many factors. The method is based on computing for each input a number of incremental ratios, namely elementary effects, which are then averaged to assess the overall importance of the input. Despite its value, the method is still rarely used and instead local analyses varying one factor at a time around a baseline point are usually employed. In this piece of work we propose a revised version of the elementary effects method, improved in terms of both the definition of the measure and the sampling strategy. In the present form the method shares many of the positive qualities of the variance-based techniques, having the advantage of a lower computational cost, as demonstrated by the analytical examples. The method is employed to assess the sensitivity of a chemical reaction model for dimethylsulphide (DMS), a gas involved in climate change. Results of the sensitivity analysis open up the ground for model reconsideration: some model components may need a more thorough modelling effort while some others may need to be simplified. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate.

Hence a concise overview of the appropriate literature has been made, followed by five case studies.

A better understanding of occupant behaviors is needed in order to manage this uncertainty; as such many studies have been dedicated to this topic. The current paper reviewed the research on adaptive occupant behaviors by sorting it into three categories. The first group encompasses all observational studies. The second group includes modeling studies. The third group incorporates the simulation studies. The current paper presents the methodologies used in these studies, discusses the limitations associated with their application, and develops recommendations for future work. Generalized linear models - in particular, logistic regression models - were found to be appropriate for modeling occupant behavior. Reversal of adaptive behaviors (e.g. window closing) was modeled with deadband models or survival models. Occupant models were typically simulated as discrete-time Markov processes. It was concluded that with appropriate selection of building geometry and materials and occupant-predicting control strategies, impact of occupant behaviors on the building performance can be reduced. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Several neural network (NN) algorithms have been reported in the literature. They include various representations and architectures and therefore are suitable for different applications. In the present study, three NN algorithms are compared according to their convergence velocities in training and performances in testing. Based on the study and test results, although the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm has been found being faster and having better performance than the other algorithms in training, the resilient back-propagation algorithm has the best accuracy in testing period. IPC Code: G06N3/02 Many of the activities associated with the planning and operation of the components of a water resource system require forecasts of future events. For the hydrologic component, there is a need for both short-term and long-term forecasts of stream-flow events in order to optimize the system or to plan for future expansion or reduction. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have proven to be an efficient alternative to traditional methods for modeling qualitative and quantitative water resource variables 1-9 . Recently, numerous ANN-based rainfall-runoff models have been proposed to forecast stream-flow 10-18 . ANN concepts and applications in hydrology have been discussed recently by the ASCE Task Committee on Application of ANN in Hydrology 19 , which conclude that ANNs may be perceived as alternative modeling tools worthy of further exploration. It is important to note that on average 90{\%} of the application cases in hydrology have used the conventional feed forward neural network, namely the standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained with the back-propagation algorithm 20 . Recently, Maier and Dandy 21 dealt with the use of the ANN model for the prediction and forecasting of water resources variables. It is evident from the literature that no study has been carried out to utilize the input-output mapping capability of Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), conjugate gradient (CG) and resilient back-propagation (RB) neural network training algorithms in the forecasting of stream-flow. Therefore, the first case in the present study was devoted to the utilization of the input-output mapping capabilities of these three neural network algorithms in daily stream-flow forecasting.},

abstract = {Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems recycle and reuse runoff to meet demand. RWH may also provide an additional benefit, runoff reduction or capture. Most studies of RWH have focused upon water supply exclusively. We evaluate decentralized RWH systems across a wide range of land uses and locations in Virginia for water supply and runoff capture, using the Rainwater Analysis and Simulation Program (RASP) model. RASP simulates an RWH system using storage volume, roof area, irrigated area, and indoor nonpotable demand as inputs. A lifecycle cost-benefit model of RWH was developed. Water supply and runoff capture reliability were assessed in each simulation. Near-optimal solutions were identified for each case and location using a nonlinear metaheuristic algorithm. While positive net benefits were not achieved in any of the land-use cases or locations, distinct differences were observed. A 20{\%} reliability target was achieved, or nearly so, for commercial, office, and high density residential cases, which also had the lowest runoff capture unit costs. In all cases, water supply reliability was binding. Statistical analysis indicated that costs variability can be characterized by two locations in Virginia; for water supply or runoff capture, three locations are necessary, and within specific locations, some land-uses could be combined. Cost effectiveness analysis of each land use provided a means of identifying least cost solutions for water supply and runoff capture. Net benefits were found to be very sensitive to water and wastewater charges. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis plays an important role in building energy analysis. It can be used to identify the key variables affecting building thermal performance from both energy simulation models and observational study. This paper is focused on the application of sensitivity analysis in the field of building performance analysis. First, the typical steps of implementation of sensitivity analysis in building analysis are described. A number of practical issues in applying sensitivity analysis are also discussed, such as the determination of input variations, the choice of building energy programs, how to reduce computational time for energy models. Second, the sensitivity analysis methods used in building performance analysis are reviewed. These methods can be categorized into local and global sensitivity analysis. The global methods can be further divided into four approaches: regression, screening-based, variance-based, and meta-model sensitivity analysis. Recent research has been concentrated on global methods because they can explore the whole input space and most of them allow the self-verification, i.e., how much variance of the model output (building energy consumption) has been explained by the method used in the analysis. Third, we discuss several important topics, which are often overlooked in the domain of building performance analysis. These topics include the application of sensitivity analysis in observational study, how to deal with correlated inputs, the computation of the variations of sensitivity index, and the software issues. Lastly, the practical guidance is given based on the advantages and disadvantaged of different sensitivity analysis methods in assessing building thermal performance. The recommendations for further research in the future are made to provide more robust analysis in assessing building energy performance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this study, the optimum thickness of thermal insulation used to reduce heat gain and losses in buildings is investigated under dynamic thermal conditions by using the climatic conditions of Elazig, Turkey. Numerical method based on an implicit finite difference procedure which has been previously validated is used to determine yearly cooling and heating transmission loads, yearly averaged time lag and decrement factor under steady periodic conditions. These loads are used as inputs to an economic model for the determination of the optimum insulation thickness. The optimum insulation thicknesses, energy savings and payback periods are calculated by using life-cycle cost analysis over lifetime of 20 years of the building. Results show that the optimum insulation thicknesses vary between 5.4 and 19.2 cm, energy savings vary between 86.26 and 146.05 {\$}/m 
                        2, and payback periods vary between 3.56 and 8.85 years for different insulation materials. The environmental impacts of thermal insulation are also investigated.

The purpose of this work was to apply the artificial neural network (ANNs) for an hourly prediction, 24-672 h in advance of (IT) and (IH) in buildings found in hot-humid region. The inputs used in the model are 12 last values of indoor and outdoor air temperature and relative humidity. The experimental building is built with cement hallow block in Douala-Cameroon. IT and IH were collected for 24 months. The experimental data were used to determine the optimal ANN structure with levenberg-marquardt algorithm using Matlab software. The optimal structure was the multilayer perceptron (MLP) with 36 input variables, 10 hidden neurons and two neurons in the output layer. The activation functions were respectively the hyperbolic tangent in the hidden layer and the linear function in the output layer. Moreover, the IT and IH results simulated by using the ANN model were strongly correlated with the experimental data, with the coefficient of correlation of 0.9850 for IT and 0.9853 for IH. These results testified that ANN can be used for hourly IT and IH prediction.},

This study aims to analyze and illustrate the potential usefulness of combining first and second-order sensitivity analysis, applied to a building energy model (ESP-r). Through the example of an apartment building, a sensitivity analysis is performed using the method of elementary effects (also known as the Morris method), including an analysis of the interactions between the input parameters (second-order analysis). The usefulness of higher-order analysis is highlighted to support the results of the first-order analysis better.

abstract = {Abstract Designing with building performance simulation feedback in the early design stage has existed since the early days of computational modeling. However, as a consequence of a fragmented building industry building performance simulations (BPSs) in the early design stage are closely related to who is creating and operating the BPS models. This paper critically reviews the different ways designers and analysts use BPS in the early design stage. One of the key findings is that most tools and methods used in the early design stages are insufficient to provide valid feedback while in the same time being flexible enough to accommodate a rapid changing design process. The main concern points to the way geometrical models and analytical models are combined and how this affects the way the buildings are designed and perform. This paper concludes that integrated dynamic models may combine a design tool, a visual programming language and a BPS to provide better support for the designer during the early stages of design as opposed to alternatives such as the current implementation of IFC or gbXML or the unaccompanied use of simulation packages.},

We propose a simulation-based approach that can help overcome several of the existing limitations. The methodology combines building performance simulation together with sensitivity analysis and structured parametric studies to provide multi-scale, multi-disciplinary information about the performance of different product variants. The strength of this computational approach lies in increased opportunity for analysis and informed decision-making on the basis of whole-building performance information, and therefore less dependence on trial and error procedures.

abstract = {The building design community is challenged by continuously increasing energy demands, which are often combined with ambitious goals for indoor environment, for environmental impact, and for building costs. To aid decision-making, building simulation is widely used in the late design stages, but its application is still limited in the early stages in which design decisions have a major impact on final building performance and costs. The early integration of simulation software faces several challenges, which include time-consuming modeling, rapid change of the design, conflicting requirements, input uncertainties, and large design variability. In addition, building design is a multi-collaborator discipline, where design decisions are influenced by architects, engineers, contractors, and building owners. This review covers developments in both academia and in commercial software industry that target these challenges. Identified research areas include statistical methods, optimisation, proactive simulations, knowledge based input generation, and interoperability between CAD-software and building performance software. Based on promising developments in literature, we propose a simulation framework that facilitates proactive, intelligent, and experience based building simulation which aid decision making in early design. To find software candidates accommodating this framework, we compare existing software with regard to intended usage, interoperability, complexity, objectives, and ability to perform various parametric simulations.},

abstract = {Accurate building energy prediction plays an important role in improving the energy efficiency of buildings. This paper proposes a homogeneous ensemble approach, i.e., use of Random Forest (RF), for hourly building energy prediction. The approach was adopted to predict the hourly electricity usage of two educational buildings in North Central Florida. The RF models trained with different parameter settings were compared to investigate the impact of parameter setting on the prediction performance of the model. The results indicated that RF was not very sensitive to the number of variables (mtry) and using empirical mtry is preferable because it saves time and is more accurate. RF was compared with regression tree (RT) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to validate the superiority of RF in building energy prediction. The prediction performances of RF measured by performance index (PI) were 14–25{\%} and 5–5.5{\%} better than RT and SVR, respectively, indicating that RF was the best prediction model in the comparison. Moreover, an analysis based on the variable importance of RF was performed to identify the most influential features during different semesters. The results showed that the most influential features vary depending on the semester, indicating the existence of different operational conditions for the tested buildings. A further comparison between RF trained with yearly and monthly data indicated that the energy usage prediction for educational buildings could be improved by taking into consideration their energy behavior changes during different semesters.},

@article{Rouchier2018a,
abstract = {Due to the ill-posedness of many inverse problems, parameter estimates are often prone to a possibly large uncertainty, caused by a series of errors and approximations in the experimental and modelling work. Stochastic state-space models for time series modelling incorporate a term of process noise that represents system error; most studies on building thermal model calibration however employ deterministic models that overlook this error. This paper investigates how accounting for modelling errors affects the results of model calibration. Several simplified models are defined to simulate the indoor temperature of an experimental test cell. Some models include process noise and others do not. The parameters of each model are then learned repeatedly by using several training datasets from the test cell. The MCMC algorithm is used for training. The robustness of parameter estimates between independent trainings is evaluated. Then, the forecasting ability of the deterministic and stochastic options are compared, in terms of accuracy and robustness. Results show that stochastic modelling considerably increases the uncertainty of parameter estimates, but ensures their consistency between separate trainings, whereas deterministic models are less robust and offer a less reliable forecasting.},

abstract = {Determining the importance of independent variables is of practical relevance to ecologists and managers concerned with allocating limited resources to the management of natural systems. Although techniques that identify explanatory variables having the largest influence on the response variable are needed to design management actions effectively, the use of various indices to evaluate variable importance is poorly understood. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we compared six different indices commonly used to evaluate variable importance; zero-order correlations, partial correlations, semipartial correlations, standardized regression coefficients, Akaike weights, and independent effects. We simulated four scenarios to evaluate the indices under progressively more complex circumstances that included correlation between explanatory variables, as well as a spurious variable that was correlated with other explanatory variables, but not with the dependent variable. No index performed perfectly under all circumstances, but partial correlations and Akaike weights performed poorly in all cases. Zero-order correlations was the only measure that detected the presence of a spurious variable, whereas only independent effects assigned overlap areas correctly once the spurious variable was removed. We therefore recommend using zero-order correlations to eliminate predictor variables with correlations near zero, followed by the use of independent effects to assign overlap areas and rank variable importance.},

abstract = {This article presents key energy use figures and explores the energy saving potentials in office buildings across Europe by simulating several currently available scenarios. The information provided in this research work is based on a review of relevant literature and the results of EnergyPlus simulations of a reference office building that can be considered as a representative office building across Europe. Three locations were selected to represent the three climate zones in which Europe was divided. Lighting has been pointed out as an area with significant improvement potentials. These improvements have been investigated by using two scenarios with different lighting control systems. In both cases and regardless of the location of the office building, the energy savings were achieved with already existing technology and will bring important reductions in the overall energy bill. Two further aspects were investigated in this work: the first one is an improvement of the insulation of the windows and the external walls (U-value) and the second one the orientation of the building. Unlikely to the lighting improvements, the location of the buildings highly influences the amount of energy required by HVAC systems. It is observed that higher insulation factors are recommended in cold and medium climate zones while they should be carefully chosen in the warmer climate zones. Office buildings constructed in warm climate zones are subjected to higher heat gains that cannot be easily released from buildings within a well-insulated envelope. Consequently, the energy demand for cooling purposes is increased, affecting the overall energy consumption and the economic performance of the building. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {For many years, the practice of implementing a design stage building energy performance simulation (BEPS) model has been overshadowed by a perceived lack of accurate results, when predicted model figures are compared with actual usage, post-occupancy. With the worldwide push for more efficient buildings, this perception of lack of accuracy is becoming an important issue. Research has primarily focussed on the examination of post-occupancy calibrated models. In the construction industry, most BEPS models are built to show compliance with national standards and/or regulations, such as ASHRAE or the UK's Part L, or a voluntary code such as LEED™. This is done at the design stage, before construction has commenced, as compliance usually must be shown as part of the regulatory planning and early design process. Examining two very different buildings, a methodology has been devised to identify the groups of influential parameters within a design stage BEPS model and determine quantitatively, how influential these groups might be on the predicted energy usage. The study finds that many similar issues exist in both building's design models, even though the buildings are in different countries, of different operational characteristics and had design models built at differing levels of complexity. The process of developing the most accurate design stage BEPS model is broken down into nine possible model stages and each of the nine is quantitatively assessed. The study gives pertinent guidance to an energy modeller as to the likely accuracy of their model, depending on what data has been used in the model's creation.},

First, given the multitude of application scenarios (involving different users, different phases of the building delivery process, different queries, etc.) in which building performance simulation can be deployed, we propose a conceptual framework in terms of a multi-dimensional simulation deployment space. To demonstrate the desirability and usability of such a framework, we provide two specific case studies, involving deployment instances of probabilistic and non-probabilistic occupancy models. One case study focuses on occupancy model deployment options in the context of simulation-based predictive building systems control.

abstract = {Decreasing the energy consumption of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems is becoming increasingly important due to rising cost of fossil fuels and environmental concerns. Therefore, finding novel ways to reduce energy consumption in buildings without compromising comfort and indoor air quality is an ongoing research challenge. One proven way of achieving energy efficiency in HVAC systems is to design systems that use novel configurations of existing system components. Each HVAC discipline has specific design requirements and each presents opportunities for energy savings. Energy efficient HVAC systems can be created by re-configuring traditional systems to make more strategic use of existing system parts. Recent research has demonstrated that a combination of existing air conditioning technologies can offer effective solutions for energy conservation and thermal comfort. This paper investigates and reviews the different technologies and approaches, and demonstrates their ability to improve the performance of HVAC systems in order to reduce energy consumption. For each strategy, a brief description is first presented and then by reviewing the previous studies, the influence of that method on the HVAC energy saving is investigated. Finally, a comparison study between these approaches is carried out. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The residential energy consumption has been studied in many countries as it usually accounts for a large percentage of the total energy consumption. Energy end-uses have also been a matter of concern as they can assist energy system planning. The objective of this paper is to assess the actual scenario of electricity consumption and estimate electricity end-uses in the residential sector of Brazil for different bioclimatic zones. The analysis is based on a survey performed by 17 energy utilities enclosing a total of 17,643 houses or flats over 12 states in Brazil. The survey was performed to obtain electricity consumption data for all household appliances found in houses and flats. The electricity end-uses were estimated by performing weighted averages according to the location of the dwellings in each bioclimatic zone. Results indicate that the largest end-uses are for refrigerator and freezer together, which account for about 38-49{\%} of the electricity consumption in dwellings in Brazil. Air-conditioning and electric shower are the end-uses that are more dependent on the climatic conditions. The main conclusion that can be made from the analysis is that air-conditioning should be a major concern in the residential sector of Brazil in the near future as its ownership is still low, but its electricity consumption is already significant mainly over summer. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

An adapted version of jEPlus (parametric shell for EnergyPlus) was created to handle the jobs execution on the VENUS-C [1] cloud infrastructure. In addition, a web client called HUB-Engineering (HUB-E) was developed. The latter allows submissions of parametric simulations and results retrieval from any device connected to the internet. The results can be visualized and explored with a freeware interactive Parallel Coordinates Plot (PCP). Finally, a workflow is proposed to integrate the online cloud-based service within design processes of architectural and engineering practices. The workflow is tested with the parametric simulation of the energy performance of a building simulating 221,184 design options. By developing the first version of the service, which will be accessible to the AEC community, and by testing it successfully, the research shows the potential impact of cloud computing when coupled with parametric energy simulation.},

Two optimizations were then conducted taking variables from HVAC system settings, thermostat programming, and passive solar design. By integrating ANN into optimization the total simulation time was considerably reduced compared to classical optimization methodology. Results of the optimizations showed significant reduction in terms of energy consumption as well as improvement in thermal comfort. Finally, thanks to the multiobjective approach, dozens of potential designs were revealed, with a wide range of trade-offs between thermal comfort and energy consumption. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Firstly, the number of design variables and their uncertainty are relatively large, making design decisions difficult. Secondly, each design variable is likely to affect several performance indicators simultaneously, which makes it difficult to quantify the impacts of the design variables. In this paper, we perform sensitivity analyses on two generic building scenarios (a cellular office room and an open-plan office floor) in three geographic locations (London, Helsinki, and Rome).

abstract = {A computational procedure known as co-simulation has been proposed in the literature as a possibility to extend the capabilities and improve the accuracy of building performance simulation (BPS) tools. Basically, the strategy relies on the data exchanging between the BPS and a specialized software, where specific physical phenomena are simulated more accurately thanks to a more complex model, where advanced physics are taken into account. Among many possibilities where this technique can be employed, one could mention airflow, three-dimensional heat transfer or detailed HVAC systems simulation, which are commonly simplified in BPS tools. When considering complex models available in specialized software, the main issue of the co-simulation technique is the considerable computational effort demanded. This paper proposes a new methodology for time-consuming simulations with the purpose of challenging this particular issue. For a specific physical phenomenon, the approach consists of designing a new model, called prediction model, capable to provide results, as close as possible to the ones provided by the complex model, with a lower computational run time. The synthesis of the prediction model is based on artificial intelligence, being the main novelty of the paper. Basically, the prediction model is built by means of a learning procedure, using the input and output data of co-simulation where the complex model is being used to simulate the physics. Then the synthesized prediction model replaces the complex model with the purpose of reducing significantly the computational burden with a small impact on the accuracy of the results. Technically speaking, the learning phase is performed using a machine learning technique, and the model investigated here is based on a recurrent neural network model and its features and performance are investigated on a case study, where a single-zone house with a triangular prism-shaped attic model is co-simulated with both CFX (CFD tool) and Domus (BPS tool) programs. Promising results lead to the conclusion that the proposed strategy enables to bring the accuracy of advanced physics to the building simulation field – using prediction models – with a much reduced computational cost. In addition, re-simulations might be run solely with the already designed prediction model, demanding computer run times even lower than the ones required by the lumped models available in the BPS tool.},

abstract = {In the last years, multi-objective optimization techniques became into one of the main challenges of the building energy efficiency area. The objective of this paper is to develop and validate a computational code for multi-objective building performance optimization by linking an evolutionary algorithm and a building simulation software in a powerful cluster. A sophisticated version of the multi-objective Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was implemented in Python code to determine the optimal building design, which allows working with categorical and discrete variables, and the objectives were evaluated using the building energy simulation software EnergyPlus. NSGA-II was implemented to run in a high-performance cluster for the parallel computing of the fitness of each population (set of possible designs). In this work, the strengths of the proposed method were demonstrated by its application to the optimal design of a typical single-family house, located in the Argentine Littoral region. This house has some rooms conditioned only by natural ventilation, and other rooms with natural ventilation supplemented by mechanical air-conditioning (hybrid ventilation). The most influential design variables like roof types, external and internal wall types, solar orientation, solar absorptance, size, type, and windows shading of this house among others were studied in two complex cases of 108and 1016possibilities to obtain the best trade-off (Pareto front) between heating and cooling performance. Finally, a decision-making method was applied to select one configuration of the Pareto front. Optimal simulation results for the study cases indicated that is possible to improve up to 95{\%} the thermal comfort in naturally ventilated rooms and up to 82{\%} energy performance in air-conditioned rooms of the building with respect to the original configuration by using a design that takes simultaneous advantage of passive strategies like thermal inertia and natural ventilation. The methodology was proved to give a robust and powerful tool to design efficient dwellings reducing the optimization time from almost 12 days to 4.4 h.},

However, in the early design stages, when the envelope shape is defined, energy performance information is normally nonexistent, due to modeling for energy simulation being a time-consuming task, frequently overlooked at this phase. This paper presents a methodology to assist design decisions regarding the building envelope shape considering its implications on energy performance. Basically, this methodology involves a flexible design system, to generate alternative envelope shape designs, with integrated energy simulation, to calculate the energy demand of each design. Shape grammars are particularly suitable to encode architectural design systems, given their ability to encode compositional design principles. Their downside is the complexity in developing computer implementations. This methodology converts a grammar into a parametric design system and is illustrated with an application to the grammar for Frank Lloyd Wright's prairie houses. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis of this classification uses a bioclimatic approach in which the comfort zone and monthly climatic lines were determined and plotted on the psychrometric chart. Since the mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) is the most important input parameter for the energy balance in outdoor environments, the charts apply the ASHRAE 55-2004 standard considering the operative temperature as a function of Tmrt. Analysis for each bioclimatic zone determines the potential of passive design strategies to maintain thermal comfort in outdoor spaces and to contribute to energy efficient built environment.

abstract = {The commercial building sector has become the focus of many governmental energy reduction initiatives to achieve more sustainable development. Reducing building energy use starts by improving the design of buildings. To this end, energy modeling and simulation tools are used during the design phase to predict energy use and help designers choose and size the different building systems. Large discrepancies are however being observed between predicted and actual building energy performances. In order to determine the sources of errors and improve these predictions, the sensitivity of energy models to different input parameters needs to be evaluated. Studies in literature have extensively evaluated the sensitivity of models to the buildings' technical design parameters. However, none considered the parameters related to the energy consumption behavior of occupants, leaving their impact on energy modeling unknown. This paper presents a comprehensive sensitivity analysis study performed on the occupancy behavioral parameters of typical office buildings of different size and in different weather zones. Significant sensitivity levels were observed, varying according to both building size and weather conditions. The highest sensitivity was obtained when varying the 'heating temperature set point' parameter in small-size buildings located in US weather zone 2 Dry. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Eight cities in Brazil with different rainfall patterns were analysed. A numeric experiment was performed by means of computer simulation of rainwater harvesting. A sensitivity analysis was performed using variance-based indices for identifying the most important design parameters for rainwater harvesting systems when assessing the potential for potable water savings and underground tank capacity sizing. The uncertainty analysis was performed for different scenarios of potable water demand with stochastic variations in a normal distribution with different coefficients of variation throughout the simulated period. The results have shown that different design variables, such as potable water demand, number of occupants, rainwater demand, and roof area are important for obtaining the ideal underground tank capacity and estimating the potential for potable water savings. The stochastic variations on the potable water demand caused amplitudes of up to 4.8{\%} on the potential for potable water savings and 9.4{\%} on the ideal underground tank capacity. Average amplitudes were quite low for all cities. However, some combinations of parameters resulted in large amplitude of uncertainty and difference from uniform distribution for tank capacities and potential for potable water savings. Stochastic potable water demand generated low uncertainties in the performance evaluation of rainwater harvesting systems; therefore, uniform distribution could be used in computer simulation.},

abstract = {The main issues related to water conservation in urban centers are the increase in water supply cost, demand growth, pollution and differences in the distribution of water resources. Water conservation, the controlled and efficient use of water, includes both measures as reasonable means of water reuse. Thus, conservation practices are an effective way to meet demand and supply water to new activities and users without jeopardizing the supplying water bodies and preserving the natural environment. This study aims to examine the water management of a shopping mall, the use of rainwater harvesting combined with greywater reuse, to investigate the feasibility of these water reuse systems. For buildings in general, water loss is common due to leaks in the hydraulic and restroom equipment. These losses, which are caused by a high volume of water used and wasted in the system, are often the result of design errors, incorrect maintenance procedures and users' bad habits. In southern Brazil, where there is an abundance of rainwater, water shortages occasionally occur, particularly in the winter. One difficulty that appears on rainwater studies is the proper determination of rainwater volume that can be used to address water supply systems. In this work, the simulation method was used to determine this volume. Thus, simulations with the following variables: rainfall, catchment area and water consumption were performed. For mall's hydraulic systems, segmented alternatives are adopted. That is, focusing on the use of rainwater or greywater reuse. Other alternatives are underutilized due to sanitary issues, those are water from toilets and kitchen sinks. The adoption of greywater may be feasible if there is a significant flow of greywater to comply water demand for toilet flushing. The inspections made in this study found that the quantity of sinks was insufficient to supply an adequate amount of water to toilets and urinals. The greywater reuse system was found to be infeasible. Conversely, the rainwater harvesting system was entirely feasible and easily supplied water to all restrooms and contributed to the cooling of the air conditioning system with a short payback period. One of the challenges of this work was the need to compare the actual water consumption with a water consumption parameter used in buildings. Thus, a method that addresses the generation of specific consumption indexes for specific activity (like a mall) was used. The water consumption indices showed that this mall has a satisfactory water management program.},

The ANN use is assessed in comparison with the multivariate linear regression (MLR) technique in order to represent the potential for energy savings through the daylighting use in office buildings. The data set was based on computer simulation results obtained with 216 models and used to develop a MLR equation. The simulations were performed with Daysim (daylighting) coupled to EnergyPlus (energy). In parallel, an approximation model using ANN was applied. The method adopted for the training and validation of the ANN was a cross-validation procedure, recommended for limited data sets. The results demonstrate that the ANN have shown a better performance in representing this problem, since it presented a lower coefficient of determination and an acceptable mean square error. In addition, the ANNs presented learning skills which allow them to perform the generalization process in a better way. After being validated, the ANN is expected to provide output results for input data which have not yet been submitted to it, providing reasonable estimates of daylighting impact on electric energy need for new environments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} European Union 2018. Sensitivity analysis is an essential tool in the development of robust models for engineering, physical sciences, economics and policy-making, but typically requires running the model a large number of times in order to estimate sensitivity measures. While statistical emulators allow sensitivity analysis even on complex models, they only perform well with a moderately low number of model inputs: in higher dimensional problems they tend to require a restrictively high number of model runs unless the model is relatively linear. Therefore, an open question is how to tackle sensitivity problems in higher dimensionalities, at very low sample sizes. This article examines the relative performance of four sampling-based measures which can be used in such high-dimensional nonlinear problems. The measures tested are the Sobol' total sensitivity indices, the absolute mean of elementary effects, a derivative-based global sensitivity measure, and a modified derivative-based measure. Performance is assessed in a ‘screening' context, by assessing the ability of each measure to identify influential and non-influential inputs on a wide variety of test functions at different dimensionalities. The results show that the best-performing measure in the screening context is dependent on the model or function, but derivative-based measures have a significant potential at low sample sizes that is currently not widely recognised.},

abstract = {Office buildings must be improved to make major gains in reducing U.S. building energy use. Energy benchmarking offers initial building energy performance assessment without rigorous evaluation. Seeing that building energy use is excessive, is the first step to change. Energy benchmarks based on the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) are investigated in support of the U.S. Department of Energys Energy Partnerships program. The 1992 CBECS database is used to develop distributions of electric energy use intensities (EUIs) in office buildings for the nine U.S. census divisions. Individual building EUIs can be compared to these distributions as an indication of building energy performance. Median EUIs are less sensitive to individual building EUIs when groups of buildings are benchmarked to one another or to census division statistics. Excessive individual EUIs (exceeding 100 kWh/sqft) strongly influence averages in the CBECS database and in local sampling. Based on limited comparisons, however, both census division average and median EUIs are not reliable indicators for more localized EUIs. Stepwise linear regression modeling was used to identify the strongest determinants of office building energy use intensities. Statistically significant relations were found between building EUIs and several CBECS variables. Beyond floor area, the most dominant variables were the number of workers, number of personal computers, owner-occupancy, operating hours, and the presence of an economizer or chiller. The resulting performance models can be used to predict EUIs that are much better benchmarks than simple census division statistics.},

This has resulted in both building carbon emissions performance cal-culated at the design stage and measured during operation being expressed as performance bands (A-G) and illustrated much as they are in certify-ing consumer white goods. In the UK, for exam-ple, these types of certification are known as the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) and Display Energy Certificate (DEC) schemes – the former applying to all buildings at design/con-struction stages and the latter applying to public buildings in operation.},

The methods compared are Monte Carlo with pseudo-random numbers, Latin Hypercube Sampling, and Quasi Monte Carlo with sampling based on Sobol sequences. Generally results show superior performance of the Quasi Monte Carlo approach based on Sobol sequences in line with theoretical predictions. Latin Hypercube Sampling can be more efficient than both Monte Carlo method and Quasi Monte Carlo method but the latter inequality holds for a reduced set of function typology and at small number of sampled points. In conclusion Quasi Monte Carlo method would appear the safest bet when integrating functions of unknown typology.},

abstract = {Uncertainty exists widely in the design of district cooling systems. Due to failures or improper maintenance of components or subsystems, the cooling systems may malfunction or work with reduced performance. In the conventional design method of district cooling systems, both aspects are often ignored or considered roughly. To ensure that district cooling systems achieve the expected performance as closely as possible, a robust optimization method is proposed in this paper. This approach relies on quantifying the uncertainty at the design stage and the reliability of the cooling system in operation. By taking the total annual cost (including the capital cost, operation cost and availability risk cost) as the objective, the robust optimal design of district cooling systems can be obtained. Uncertainties in weather, building design/construction and indoor conditions are considered and reliabilities of major equipment in the systems are dealt with as well. Individual cooling systems are often alternative to district cooling systems while uncertainty and reliability issues also exist at the design stage. The role of uncertainty and reliability in the design of district cooling systems and individual cooling systems are assessed and compared. Results show that both uncertainty and reliability have greater impacts on the design of individual cooling systems.},

abstract = {Good models for building thermal behaviour are an important part of developing building energy management systems that are capable of reducing energy consumption for space heating through model predictive control. A popular approach to modelling the temperature variations of buildings is grey-box models based on lumped parameter thermal networks. By creating simplified models and calibrating their parameters from measurement data, the resulting model is both accurate and shows good generalisation capabilities. Often, parameters of such models are assumed to be a combination of different physical attributes of the building, hence they have some physical interpretation. In this paper, we investigate the dispersion of parameter estimates by use of randomisation. We show that there is significant dispersion in the parameter estimates when using randomised initial conditions for a numerical optimisation algorithm. Further, we claim that in order to assign a physical interpretation to grey-box model parameters, we require the estimated parameters to converge independently of the initial conditions and different datasets. Despite the dispersion of estimated parameters, the prediction capability of calibrated grey-box models is demonstrated by validating the models on independent data. This shows that the models are usable in a model predictive control system.},

abstract = {The architectural design variables which most influence the energy performance of a building are the envelope materials, shape and window areas. As these start to be defined in the early design stages, designers require simple tools to obtain information about the energy performance of the building for the design variations being considered at this phase. The shape factor is one of those tools, but it fails to correlate with energy demand in the presence of important solar gains. This paper presents a new design indicator of energy performance for residential buildings, the Envelope-Related Energy Demand (ERED), which aims to overcome the shortcomings of the shape factor while maintaining a reasonable simplicity of use. The inputs to ERED are areas of envelope elements (floor, walls, roofs and windows), U-values of envelope materials, solar heat gain coefficients (SHGC) of windows and site related parameters, concerning temperature and solar irradiation. ERED was validated against detailed simulation results of 8000 hypothetical residential buildings, varying in envelope shape, window areas and materials. Results show that there is a strong correlation between ERED and simulated energy demand. These results confirm the adequacy of ERED to assist design decisions in early stages of the design process. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Twenty-one of these office buildings were identified as LEED-certified, providing the opportunity for direct comparison of energy performance data for LEED and non-LEED buildings of the same type, time frame, and geographical and climate region. With regard to energy consumption and GHG emission the LEED-certified buildings, collectively, showed no savings as compared with non-LEED buildings. The subset of the LEED buildings certified at the Gold level outperformed other NYC office buildings by 20{\%}. In contrast LEED Silver and Certified office buildings underperformed other NYC office buildings. The average EPR for the LEED buildings was 78, 10 pts higher than that for all NYC office buildings, raising questions about the validity and interpretation of these EPR's. This work suggests that LEED building certification is not moving NYC toward its goal of climate neutrality.

Based on the hot climate in Chongqing, two types of experimental chambers were constructed to investigate the effects of external wall insulation on energy consumption and the indoor thermal environment. An 'energy efficient' chamber was constructed using a thermal insulation system for the external wall, and a 'basic' chamber was constructed according to the general design for residential buildings of the 1980s and 1990s. Analysis of the experimental data for power consumption and the thermal environment of the two chambers showed that the indoor thermal environment of the energy efficient chamber was less affected by the outdoor environment and could be maintained at more comfortable conditions with less energy consumption than the basic chamber. The energy consumption of the energy efficient chamber was lower than that of the basic chamber, offering a savings of up to 23.5{\%} in air conditioning energy consumption during the summer-time test period. Therefore, the results of this study demonstrate that use of an external wall insulation system can improve building energy efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

There are two fundamental methods for rating the performance of existing buildings: operational ratings based on actual energy use, and energy asset ratings based on the efficiency potential of the building's design, construction, permanent equipment and systems. The California Energy Commission has developed the Building Energy Asset Rating System (BEARS) as a cornerstone of its efforts to improve the energy efficiency of existing commercial buildings statewide. This paper will detail the approach taken for this asset rating development, including 1) the modeling approach taken, (including consideration of building type and size and selecting appropriate benchmarks), 2) development of a cost-effective field assessment protocol, and 3) establishing an appropriate scale and graphical presentation. The BEARS development team was tasked with developing a robust and practical asset rating system to suit the broadest possible range of commercial buildings – all at a cost the market can tolerate. The team has addressed many technical challenges and made trade-off choices, some of which are being tested in pilots. Beyond these technical challenges there will be many other programmatic and market-related challenges to address as the State of California pushes towards its ambitious energy efficiency goals.},

In this paper, a study on the effects of external wall insulation thickness on annual cooling and heating energy uses under different Chinese climates is reported. Firstly, two indexes: Energy Gain Ratio (EGR) and Relative Variation Ratio (RVR) of the sum of annual cooling and heating energy uses, to assess the effects of external wall insulation thickness on energy saving potential are introduced. Secondly, a model space having four different exterior zones facing four different orientations in an office building is presented and the settings of the model space described. Lastly, the simulated annual cooling and heating energy uses for the four different exterior zones at different external wall insulation thicknesses under three different climates in China, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing, are reported. The results suggested that energy saving was significant by increasing the external wall insulation thickness in exterior zones facing all orientations under Beijing's climate, since the heating energy use was dominant and can be reduced remarkably with the increase in insulation thickness. Under Shanghai's climate, increasing external wall insulation thickness to over 26. mm would not reduce the sum of annual heating and cooling energy uses in the south-facing exterior zone, but would help save energy in exterior zones facing the other three orientations. For all exterior zones under Guangzhou's climate, it was, however, hardly possible to reduce the sum of annual heating and cooling energy uses by increasing the external wall insulation thickness. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Sustainable or “green” buildings are becoming increasingly popular. This is a positive trend, since buildings require the use of vast amounts of resources and energy. They are, among other things, responsible for approximately 39{\%} of CO2 emissions and 65{\%} of waste outputs. Obviously, sustainable buildings require that their enclosure also be conceived and realized according to ecological principles. However, it appears that these green building enclosures are not always durable. Indeed, there are reports in North America of many green buildings having suffered major building enclosure failures after only a few years. This results in environmental, economical, and social impacts that can reduce or negate the positive impacts of those green buildings. The questions then become: What are the potential traps in green building design that can lead to such failures? And what can be done to avoid them? These questions are examined through examples of building enclosure failures in green buildings. These help identify potential pitfalls, which include • Disregarding building science principles when designing a green building • Designing green buildings with a configuration that is not adapted to their actual exposure conditions and context • Using materials in the wrong places and/or for the wrong purposes because they meet certain ecological criteria A durability plan, such as required in the LEED{\textregistered} Canada Credit MRc8 “Durable Building” (based on CSA Standard S478- 95 [R2001], “Guideline on durability in buildings”), can help minimize the risks of premature failure by addressing durability issues over the whole life cycle of the building. Although this does not guarantee that the building will be durable, it at least ensures that it has been designed and built to be durable. The basic elements of an actual durability plan are presented and discussed. In conclusion, some insights gained through the analysis of failures and the preparation of a durability plan are shared.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development and focus in the analysis of the Brazilian metamodels used in the residential labeling system. The metamodels represent the thermal behavior of naturally ventilated and artificially air-conditioned residential buildings. A computational simulation experiment using the EnergyPlus program was conducted taking into account naturally ventilated and artificially air-conditioned residential buildings. Several parameters were considered for parametric simulations such as thermal transmittance, thermal solar absorptance, shading device, ventilation opening factor. The multi-linear regression method was used to predict the cooling degree hours and the annual energy consumption for heating and cooling for dormitories and living room. An assessment on the accuracy of the Brazilian metamodels for residential buildings was analyzed and showed that the regressions include standard errors that may influence the metamodels accuracy. Therefore, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are presented as an alternative to improve the metamodels used in the Brazilian regulation. Comparing both statistical method multi-linear regression and artificial neural network method it can be seen that ANN presented lower results for standard deviation end root mean square errors. Therefore, ANNs are recommended to improve the accuracy of the prediction in further behavior associated with the labeling system.},
