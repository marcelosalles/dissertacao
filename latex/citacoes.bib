In this study, a soil model dedicated to pavement watering has been developed within the urban climate model SOLENE-microclimat. This watering model is presented and evaluated via a measurement campaign performed on an asphalt car park during warm days. The measurement campaign reveals that the surface cooling is mainly due to evaporation (80%). However, under warm conditions, the heat flux exchanged between the runoff water and the surface should also be modelled. Indeed, watering events are modelled through a runoff convective heat flux and a latent heat flux. The mean daily RMSE between estimated and observed surface temperature is 1.04°C, 0.86°C, 0.66°C, 0.35°C and 0.21°C respectively at the surface, 5 cm-, 10 cm-, 34 cm- and 50 cm-depths."

abstract = "There is worldwide a trend towards urbanization, and cities try to improve their sustainability by saving natural resources and energy, and to mitigate the impact of climate change. Therefore growing cities need to optimize the energy demand of their new and existing buildings. There are a large number of urban scale phenomena that influence the energy demand of buildings. One of the most important influencing phenomena is the shortwave solar and longwave radiation exchange within an urban environment. It was demonstrated that the influence of neighbouring buildings has to be considered in detail to predict correctly the building energy demand. In this study, space cooling demand of stand-alone buildings is compared with buildings in an urban street canyon configuration. Detailed radiation models for the solar and longwave radiation are used to determine the radiation exchange between the buildings. The results show a strong influence of neighbouring buildings on the space cooling demands. This influence is strongly dependent on the shading device control strategy incorporated in the building energy management. Counterintuitively the space cooling demands are in some cases are higher for low values of solar irradiance, because the shading device control directs the devices to remain open during longer time periods when irradiance values are low, leading to higher total solar gains through the windows."

In this study a detailed building energy simulation (BES) has been carried out in order to analyze the effect of neighbouring buildings on these heat flows and in order to quantify mutual influence on the space cooling and heating demand of buildings. BESs were conducted for a stand-alone building and for a building situated in a typical street canyon. This study demonstrates the importance of considering the urban microclimate conditions for the prediction of the energy demand of buildings. With the implemented model most of the thermal effects of the urban microclimate can be modeled and quantified on a street canyon scale. Due to multiple reflections higher values of solar and thermal radiation are absorbed at the façades of buildings in street canyons than those that occur at stand-alone buildings façades. These effects cause higher surface temperatures in street canyons which means higher space cooling and lower space heating demands. Other reasons that cause this phenomenon are the lower convective heat transfer coefficients in street canyons that results in a reduction of the heat removal from street canyons and contribute to plump the urban heat island effect."

An actual house was selected as case study. This is a typical, local, single-family house having some rooms conditioned only by natural ventilation, and other rooms with natural ventilation supplemented by mechanical air-conditioning (hybrid ventilation). Hence, the total degree-hours at the naturally ventilated living room and the total energy consumption by air-conditioning at the bedrooms were chosen as objective functions to be minimised. The global objective function characterising the thermal and energy performance of the house was defined as the weighted sum of these objective functions. This objective function was computed using the EnergyPlus building performance simulation programme. Then, we performed a sensitivity analysis using the Morris screening method to rank the influence of the design variables on the objective function. This showed that the type of external walls, the windows infiltration rate and the solar azimuth were the most influential design variables on the given objective function for the considered house, and also that the azimuth either had a highly nonlinear effect on the objective function or was highly correlated to the others variables, deserving in any case a finer discretisation. Finally, we solved an optimisation problem using genetic algorithms in order to find the optimal set of design variables for the considered house. The results highlighted the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed methodology to redesign a typical house in the Argentine Littoral region, improving hugely its thermal and energy performance."

abstract = "The use of urban vegetation in cities is a common landscape planning strategy to alleviate the heat island effect as well as to enhance building energy efficiency. The presence of trees in street canyons can effectively reduce environmental temperature via radiative shading. However, resolving shade trees in urban land surface models presents a major challenge in numerical models, especially in predicting the radiative heat exchange in canyons. In this paper, we develop a new numerical framework by incorporating shade trees into an advanced single-layer urban canopy model. This novel numerical framework is applied to Phoenix metropolitan area to investigate the cooling effect of different urban vegetation types and their potentials in saving building energy. It is found that the cooling effect by shading from trees is more significant than that by evapotranspiration from lawns, leading to a considerable saving of cooling load. In addition, analysis of human thermal comfort shows that urban vegetation plays a crucial role in creating a comfortable living environment, especially for cities located in arid or semi-arid region."

abstract = "Heat exchange between buildings and the surrounding environment is due to convective and radiative heat flows. In this study a detailed building energy simulation tool (BES) is used to analyze the effect of multiple shortwave and longwave inter-reflections exchanges between neighboring buildings with the main purpose to evaluate their influence on the heat fluxes on the external walls of street canyon buildings. These radiative exchanges modify the canyon microclimate thus influencing space cooling and heating demand of buildings. A TRNSYS canyon model has been created and validated with experimental data [1]. With the proposed model, most of the thermal effects of the urban radiative microclimate can be considered and quantified on street canyon scale. Due to multiple reflections, more solar and thermal radiation remain trapped in an urban fabric so that much more radiation is absorbed in the buildings façades in a street canyon. For this reason, some comparison has been performed between street canyon building (SCB) and stand-alone building (SAB), to account for the inter reflections between the buildings. Energy and thermodynamic studies are performed in a canyon with two orientations (N/S and E/W) and for three aspect ratio (H/W=0.5, 1 and 2). The goal is to characterize how the orientations and geometrical parameter change the inter reflections inside an urban canyon."

abstract = "This paper provides a critical review on the building neighborhood properties influencing the energy and airflows in urban neighborhoods. Specifically, the review focus is on the multi-scale modeling required to quantify this influence of the building neighborhood properties on the energy consumption in buildings. The energy consumption patterns of buildings located in dense city centers are highly dependent on the surrounding urban neighborhood, compared to the low density, suburban/rural regions, where the building energy consumption patterns are similar to an isolated building energy consumption patterns. Due to the complex nature of the outdoor airflow around the buildings in urban neighborhoods, a practical modeling approach utilizes multi-scale modeling to account for different spatial and temporal scales for the relevant transport processes. Specifically, this modeling approach aims to identify the most important neighborhood properties influencing building energy consumption. The urban morphology parameters, such as the urban plan area density, frontal area density, and mean height of the buildings represent successful examples of emerging properties suitable for development of generalized solutions and physical models at the neighborhood scale. This paper also reviews different modeling approaches that account for the impacts of the urban neighborhood properties on the thermo-fluid property of the air, surfaces, and sky in the built environment as the required inputs for accurate assessment of building energy consumption. Furthermore, these emerging properties of urban neighborhoods directly affect (1) the mitigation strategies for a better adaptation, (2) design performance metrics of neighborhoods for the green building rating systems, and (3) socio-environmental factors."
