abstract = {The airflow network (AFN) modeling approach provides an attractive balance between the accuracy and computational demand for naturally ventilated buildings. Its accuracy depends on input parameters such as wind pressure and opening discharge coefficients. In most cases, these parameters are obtained from secondary sources which are solely representative for very simplified buildings, i.e. for buildings without facade details. Although studies comparing wind pressure coefficients or discharge coefficients from different sources exist, the knowledge regarding the effect of input data on AFN is still poor. In this paper, the influence of wind pressure data on the accuracy of a coupled AFN-BES model for a real building with natural wind- and stack-driven ventilation was analyzed. The results of 8 computation cases with different wind pressure data from secondary sources were compared with the measured data. Both the indoor temperatures and the airflow were taken into account. The outcomes indicated that the source of wind pressure data had a significant influence on the model performance.},

@techreport{IPCC-TGICA2007,
abstract = {In 1997, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) formed the Task Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impact and Climate Assessment (TGICA)1 whose role is to provide regional climate change information with particular focus on capacity building for future IPCC assessments. These Guidelines represent part of an initiative by the Task Group to improve consistency in the selection and application of scenarios2 in climate impact and adaptation assessments and, in so doing, to reduce the time lag of information exchange between the different scientific communities engaged in climate change research. They offer guidance on the interpretation and application of scenario data in impact and adaptation assessment. They also provide user support for the IPCC Data Distribution Centre (DDC), which has been established under the direction of the Task Group to make freely available a number of recent global data sets of baseline and scenario information on climatic, environmental and socio-economic conditions. This is a completely revised version of the original Guidelines, which first appeared in December 1999. Since that time a new set of emissions scenarios (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, SRES Nakicenovic et al., 2000) and new chapters on scenarios (Mearns et al., 2001; Carter et al., 2001, 2007; Morita et al., 2001; Nakicenovic et al., 2007) have been prepared by the IPCC. Furthermore, large amounts of new information related to the SRES scenarios have been added to the Data Distribution Centre and more detailed guidance material on specific topics described in this document has been developed or is under development by the TGICA in parallel with these generic guidelines, concerning: Climate scenarios developed from regional climate model experiments (Mearns et al., 2003) Climate scenarios developed using statistical downscaling techniques (Wilby et al., 2004) Global and regional sea level scenarios Socio-economic scenarios, including population, gross domestic product and land-use change Scenarios of atmospheric composition, including carbon dioxide concentration, tropospheric and near-surface ozone abundance and sulphur concentration and deposition These can (or will) be found on the DDC and are referenced at appropriate points in this document, the individual sections of which have been designed as stand-alone introductions to different sets of information on the DDC website.},

abstract = {We present a study of natural ventilation design during the early (conceptual) stage of a building's design, based on a field study in a naturally ventilated office in California where we collected data on occupants' window use, local weather conditions, indoor environmental conditions, and air change rates based on tracer-gas decay. We performed uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to determine which design parameters have most impact on the uncertainty associated with ventilation performance predictions. Using the results of the field study along with wind-tunnel measurements and other detailed analysis, we incrementally improved our early-design-stage model. The improved model's natural ventilation performance predictions were significantly more accurate than those of the first draft early-stage-design model that employed model assumptions typical during initial design. This process highlighted significant limitations in the EnergyPlus software's models of occupant-driven window control. We conclude with recommendations on key design parameters including window control, wind pressure coefficients and weather data resolution to help improve early-design-stage predictions of natural ventilation performance using EnergyPlus.},

abstract = {This work develops guidance and tools to understand the performance, improve the design, and simplify the evaluation of naturally ventilated low-rise commercial buildings in warm and hot climates. We conducted ∼50,000 detailed energy and airflow simulations in 427 locations across Brazil, varying 55 parameters representing building morphology, fenestration, construction properties, internal gains, operating times, wind modifiers, flowpaths, window control, and soil traits. Comfort performance was quantified by the average annual fraction of occupied hours that exceeded the upper limit of an adaptive comfort zone, and investigated with sensitivity analysis and machine learning methods. Results indicated that, after climate, building size (both footprint area and number of stories) and internal gains were most influential and were positively associated with discomfort. Adding air movement with ceiling fans and providing for night ventilation both proved highly effective comfort interventions. Except for roof solar absorptance, opaque envelope changes, including increasing insulation or thermal mass, had only marginal impacts. A support vector regression metamodel, requiring 29 easily obtainable inputs plus a weather file, was fit to the simulation results and successfully validated (R2=0.97). The metamodel was developed as a simplified compliance path for naturally ventilated buildings to enhance Brazil's commercial building performance labeling program, which, because it currently provides such a path only for air conditioned buildings, may discouraging decision-makers from considering even more efficient passive solutions. We use a case study to show how the metamodel, which we will distribute publicly, can also serve as a design tool, and demonstrate that modifying a small set of parameters can drastically improve thermal performance and achieve sustainable comfort in hot and warm climates.},

abstract = {The action of opening a window is the most intuitive and simple response to controlling overheating in a room. However, it relies on the vagaries of occupant interaction to exploit the passive design potential and achieve comfortable results. An understanding of occupant behaviour is thus of significance in the design and evaluation of naturally ventilated buildings. This paper demonstrates the link between facade design, thermal performance, occupant perception, and window use in naturally ventilated offices in summer, based on a pilot study monitoring offices in Cambridge, UK. Survey results indicate that facade design has a large impact on the occupants' perceived control over and satisfaction with their environments. The research reveals that there is a close connection between perceived control and actual control (with respect to window use), and that occupants with a high level of perceived control more frequently use their windows than others with a low level of perceived control. Positive feedback loops between occupant action and effect reinforce appropriate behaviour and the paper shows that it is possible to derive statistically significant behavioural models to predict window use for different facade conditions.},

abstract = {This paper presents an investigation of the natural ventilation cooling potential (NVCP) of office buildings in the five generally recognised climate zones in China using the Thermal Resistance Ventilation (TRV) model, which is a simplified, coupled, thermal and airflow model. The acceptable operative temperature for naturally conditioned space supplied by the ASHARE Standard 55-2004 has been used for the comfort temperature setting. Dynamic simulations for a typical office room in the five representative cities, which are Harbin, Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming and Guangzhou, have been carried out. The study demonstrates that the NVCP depends on the multiple impacts of climate, the building's thermal characteristics, internal gains, ventilation profiles and regimes. The work shows how the simplified method can be used to generate detailed, indoor, operative temperature data based on the various building conditions and control profiles which are used to investigate the NVCP at the strategic design stage. The simulation results presented in this paper can be used as a reference guideline for natural ventilation design in China.},

abstract = {Throughout history, natural ventilation has remained the preferred choice for the majority of residential buildings, while, in commercial buildings, natural ventilation went from being the single option to somewhat of a lost art as mechanical ventilation systems and air conditioning became the standard during the second half of the twentieth century. Recently, as a result of environmental concerns, in particular the greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, interest in natural ventilation in commercial buildings has seen a resurgence. Unfortunately, the hiatus in natural ventilation use in these buildings has resulted in the loss of existing design know-how and consequently limited new developments in a period during which comfort and indoor air quality performance standards have continuously risen. Nevertheless, the past 25 years has seen significant advances in our understanding of the fluid mechanics of natural ventilation and Architectural Fluid Mechanics has developed as a new subject. In response to these new scientific advances and in an attempt to restore confidence in the applicability of natural ventilation in practice, this paper presents ten questions about building natural ventilation that span the different scales of the problem, from an urban context down to the neighbourhood and the building itself. These questions are commonly asked when a designer is considering natural ventilation as the preferred means of cooling a non-domestic building, and the answers are intended to provide succinct links to the latest knowledge, identify areas that require additional research and assist designers in making appropriate decisions.},

abstract = {The building sector has a significant share in a county's total greenhouse gas emissions, and as a reaction to the Kyoto commitment most countries are constantly adjusting building energy requirements in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the climate change. While it is easier to set standards for the building fabric and for technical systems, the impact of occupants on comfort and energy performance in buildings has proven to be important, but is a lot harder to account for. This paper therefore aims to investigate the magnitude of influence of occupants in relation to climate and architectural design on thermal comfort and CO2 emissions in offices in different climate zones of the world. The aim is to identify typical patterns and key parameters for optimisation. For this purpose, a parametric study for a typical cellular office room has been conducted using the simulation software EnergyPlus. Two different occupant scenarios are each compared with three different architectural design variations and modelled in the context of three different locations for the IPCC climate change scenario A2 for 2030. The evaluation of the results is focused on two different modes of operation. For natural ventilation adaptive thermal comfort according to ASHRAE Standard 55 has been evaluated, and for mixed mode operation final energy consumption and resulting CO2 emissions. The results indicate a first approach to estimate comfort levels based on climatic data, architectural design priorities and occupancy. Additionally, warmer climates seem to have larger optimisation potential for comfort and energy performance in offices compared to colder climates.},

The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate the adaptive method application proposed by ASHRAE 55 in two different climates in Brazil. This method relates the conditions for comfort to the "prevailing mean outdoor air temperature". The currently available version of the Standard allows for linear and exponential methods to calculate the "prevailing mean", and both are tested to establish the acceptability zones. The results indicate that choosing any of the methods to calculate the prevailing mean outdoor air temperature gives similar results when the temperature amplitudes are small; but it can lead to different limits of acceptability, and consequently sum of discomfort hours, when significant day-to-day temperature variations are present. In addition, the results indicate that it is possible to find significant percentages of thermal acceptability from previous studies below the lower limit of acceptability proposed by the Standard. As a result, a "clo adjustment zone" is suggested.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V. Buildings are a significant contributor to the rapidly increasing electricity demand in Egypt which is straining the existing supply network causing economic and social impacts. There are current initiatives aimed at improved building performance including adoption of international standards. The performance of existing Egyptian buildings is not well understood making the impact of these international standards uncertain. This paper provides insight into performance of current Egyptian office buildings through a multi-building energy survey and a detailed case study. The most common office type in the survey has natural ventilation and local cooling. A process to capture observed performance in a representative model and input parameter set is presented. The model is used to investigate performance impacts of parameters including: location, weather, building envelope, intensity of occupancy, behaviour, and installed systems including the HVAC strategy. HVAC strategy was identified as the most significant factor. Typical Egyptian offices with natural ventilation and local cooling systems under personal control have electricity demand less than 50{\%} of centrally serviced buildings. System efficiencies (HVAC, lights, equipment) and occupant behaviour (e.g. use of systems, temperatures) were also identified as significant factors, each with potential of around 30{\%} saving compared to current typical offices. Possible policy measures to promote energy efficient systems and energy conscious behaviour are proposed which together can reduce the energy demand of typical offices by 50{\%}. Trade-offs between energy use and indoor environmental quality (IEQ) are discussed.},

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis plays an important role in building energy analysis. It can be used to identify the key variables affecting building thermal performance from both energy simulation models and observational study. This paper is focused on the application of sensitivity analysis in the field of building performance analysis. First, the typical steps of implementation of sensitivity analysis in building analysis are described. A number of practical issues in applying sensitivity analysis are also discussed, such as the determination of input variations, the choice of building energy programs, how to reduce computational time for energy models. Second, the sensitivity analysis methods used in building performance analysis are reviewed. These methods can be categorized into local and global sensitivity analysis. The global methods can be further divided into four approaches: regression, screening-based, variance-based, and meta-model sensitivity analysis. Recent research has been concentrated on global methods because they can explore the whole input space and most of them allow the self-verification, i.e., how much variance of the model output (building energy consumption) has been explained by the method used in the analysis. Third, we discuss several important topics, which are often overlooked in the domain of building performance analysis. These topics include the application of sensitivity analysis in observational study, how to deal with correlated inputs, the computation of the variations of sensitivity index, and the software issues. Lastly, the practical guidance is given based on the advantages and disadvantaged of different sensitivity analysis methods in assessing building thermal performance. The recommendations for further research in the future are made to provide more robust analysis in assessing building energy performance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Building performance simulations (BPS) are used to test different designs and systems with the intention of reducing building costs and energy demand while ensuring a comfortable indoor climate. Unfortunately, software for BPS is computationally intensive. This makes it impractical to run thousands of simulations for sensitivity analysis and optimization. Worse yet, millions of simulations may be necessary for a thorough exploration of the high-dimensional design space formed by the many design parameters. This computational issue may be overcome by the creation of fast metamodels. In this paper, we aim to find suitable metamodeling techniques for diverse outputs from BPS. We consider five indicators of building performance and eight test problems for the comparison six popular metamodeling techniques – linear regression with ordinary least squares (OLS), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), multivariate adaptive regression splines, Gaussian process regression (GPR), and neural network (NN). The methods are compared with respect to accuracy, efficiency, ease-of-use, robustness, and interpretability. To conduct a fair and in-depth comparison, a methodological approach is pursued using exhaustive grid searches for model selection assisted by sensitivity analysis. The comparison shows that GPR produces the most accurate metamodels, followed by NN and MARS. GPR is robust and easy to implement but becomes inefficient for large training sets compared to NN and MARS. A coefficient of determination, R2, larger than 0.9 have been obtained for the BPS outputs using between 128 and 1024 training points. In contrast, accurate metamodels with R2 values larger than 0.99 can be achieved for all eight test problems using only 32–256 training points.},

@article{Samani2016,
abstract = {Pre-fabricated composite buildings are proposed as sustainable sheltering and housing solutions for developing countries. This work compares different passive cooling techniques of shading, natural ventilation, cool painting and increase in thickness of interior gypsum plaster for these buildings to tackle overheating in hot climates. The studied techniques are measured and compared in terms of indoor air temperature by calculating four indicators of maximum, minimum, average of highest 5{\%} and average of lowest 5{\%} temperatures as well as thermal comfort of the occupants based on two acceptability rates of ASHRAE 55 and three acceptability limits of EN 15251 standards in three climates: Porto, Nairobi and Mumbai. The findings of this comparison bring insights into the effectiveness of passive cooling techniques, that can be highly beneficial at design level. Results point out improvements by all studied techniques, even if these quantitatively depend on the presence of the occupants and the choice of the performance indicators. Finally, further indicators such as stored heat, solar radiation heat gain and surface temperature are analyzed, to explain causes and effects associated with studied passive cooling techniques. Results of these comparisons pointed out that the combined implementation of all techniques combined is effective enough to provide thermal comfort of the occupants during almost all annual occupancy in Nairobi measured by acceptability rate of 80{\%} of ASHRAE 55 and Category III of EN 15251.},

@article{Corgnati2013,
abstract = {The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD recast, 2010/31/EU) requires Member States to define minimum requirements of energy performance of buildings and building components with a view to achieving cost-optimal levels. In order to calculate the cost optimal level of minimum energy performance, Member States are required to create a set of reference buildings, at national or regional level, to be used in the calculations. This paper introduces to the concept of reference buildings and to the state of art at an international level. In particular, a general methodology for the creation of reference buildings is illustrated. A case study of an office building as a reference building for the Italian existing building stock is then shown. The process concerning the building definition and modeling was carried out by means of dynamic energy simulation program EnergyPlus.},
